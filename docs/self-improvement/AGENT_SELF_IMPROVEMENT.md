# Agent self-improvement

Suggestions emitted by delegated agents for improving the agent ecosystem itself
— prompt tweaks, missing context, redundant steps, new-subagent candidates,
tooling gaps. Live entries split by category; this file is the index + spec.

## Format

```
- <YYYY-MM-DD> · <agent-name> · [<category>] · P<0-3> — <one-line title>
  Details: (single paragraph or short bullet list — context that explains why)
  Concrete next action: (what unblocks the entry)
  Status: open | deferred | observational
  Last-reviewed: <YYYY-MM-DD>   # default = creation date; bump on each sweep
```

Applied entries are archived immediately to [`self-improvement/categories/applied.md`](self-improvement/categories/applied.md).

## Categories

- **bug** — defect in shipped behaviour (production or test).
- **process** — workflow friction; orchestrator-packet discipline; shortcuts an
  agent finds itself doing manually that should be encoded in its prompt;
  context an agent had to discover that should be pre-loaded.
- **tooling** — missing CLI / lint / vexp invocation / harness automation gap.
- **infra** — build system / CI / scaffolding / new-subagent candidates.
- **test** — test coverage gap, fixture, bucket-E wiring.
- **security** — exploitable surface; secret leakage; sandbox escape; defense-in-depth.

`external-blockers.md` carries entries that can only be resolved outside this
repo (vexp tool, GitHub repo settings).

## Priority

- **P0** — data corruption · exploitable · merge-block.
- **P1** — load-bearing · silent failure · production regression.
- **P2** — test infra · process gap · cross-agent friction.
- **P3** — doc edit · cosmetic · single-agent prompt tweak.

Mandatory on every `open` entry.

## Workflow

1. Delegated agents end every report with `## Self-improvement`. Empty is fine.
2. Orchestrator reads, dedupes, appends to the matching category file (not here).
3. When evidence accumulates (mentioned by ≥2 agents OR blocks the same
   workflow ≥3 times), apply: edit the relevant agent prompt(s) in `agents/`
   or AGENTS.md; flip Status to `applied`; move the entry to `applied.md`.

## Triage cadence

Sweep when (a) opening any PR that touches `agents/`, (b) any single live
category file exceeds ~20 open items, or (c) a P0 entry has aged ≥7 days
without movement.

> **Count maintenance**: each "Live count" is the number of `^- 20YY-MM-DD` entries in the linked file (`grep -c '^- 20' self-improvement/categories/<file>.md`). The applied-archive count is the same `grep -c '^- 20' self-improvement/categories/applied.md`. `scripts/dev/test-backlog-counts.sh` runs at the pre-push gate (`test-all.sh` discovery) and refuses if any row diverges from the actual file. Update the row in the same commit that adds / archives / removes an entry, or run `bash scripts/dev/test-backlog-counts.sh --fix` to rewrite the table from current file counts.
