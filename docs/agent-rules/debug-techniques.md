# Debug techniques (load on-demand)

Trigger: **debugging** a visual / behavioural issue. These project-wide techniques are mandatory whenever they apply. The full behavioural-bug investigation loop is `agents/core/debug-detective.md` + its `debug-instrument` skill; this doc holds the two standalone techniques AGENTS.md used to inline.

## Pink-clear UI gap detection

For "is the background ever visible behind panels?" / "are dock gaps still leaking?" questions, set the clear color to magenta (`glClearColor(1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)` on Standalone, equivalent `ClearRenderTargetView` color on DX12). Any visible pink is a guaranteed dock gap or transparent region. Pair with a screenshot + per-pixel pink scan for objective regression tests.

## Exe staleness check

After every rebuild, `ls -la` both the patched output and the most-likely-stale exe paths side-by-side, compare mtimes, and name the **exact** path the user should run. Multiple build outputs (`build/ninja-iter-msvc/`, `build/ninja-debug-msvc/`, `build/ninja-publish-msvc/`, worktree builds) make wrong-exe testing a common time-sink — orchestrator + perf / build agents all enforce this.

## Local bucket-E — native GL only

Local bucket-E runs use the native GPU/GL on the dev box. The Mesa software-GL path (llvmpipe / d3d12-gallium) is **CI-headless-only** — it may crash some local GL stacks (the d3d12-gallium driver crashes the exe at boot on at least one dev box) and is **not a supported local config**. Don't try to reproduce a CI Mesa-lane failure against software GL locally; run bucket-E against native GL instead.

## Crash capture (no WER dump)

A crash that vanishes with **no Windows Error Reporting dump and no Event-1000** is a *deliberate* `ExitProcess` from a caught SEH fault (the frame-loop filter handles the access violation and exits), not an unhandled exception — so WER never records it. Recovering the real faulting stack needs procdump (capture the death) plus a first-chance debugger break (the app's filter swallows the fault before procdump's `-e` sees it), and a per-frame autocycle harness reproduces interaction-driven crashes hands-free. Full workflow + ready-to-run scripts: [`docs/guides/crash-capture.md`](../guides/crash-capture.md).

## Hang capture (no crash, so no dump)

A process that **wedges without crashing** never trips the crash pipeline, so nothing is written and there is no stack to read. Ask the live process to dump itself instead:

Call `debug.dump_self` over the CLI or MCP surface — it returns `{wrote, path}` and the dump carries every thread's stack — then triage it with the existing tooling:

```
bash agents/scripts/core/dump-triage.sh <path>
```

This works while the UI thread is stuck because the command runs inline on the serving thread — `debug.log_tail` and `debug.mcp_status` are safe the same way, while every marshalling `debug.*` command blocks forever (`debug-instrument` SKILL.md § Run has the full table). For a hung `--spawn` child, the readiness handshake proves it had a live MCP server on a known port, so target that port. `{available:false}` means the host has no writer (Unreal/DX12, Android) — fall back to the procdump recipe in [`docs/guides/crash-capture.md`](../guides/crash-capture.md). Design + rejected alternatives: [`docs/adr/0024-self-minidump-over-in-process-stack-walk.md`](../adr/0024-self-minidump-over-in-process-stack-walk.md).

## Dump triage (.dmp)

Once a minidump (`.dmp`) is captured (procdump, or the in-app crash handler), triage it. Two tiers:

- **Symbolized stack (preferred)** — needs `cdb.exe`, which is **not** on a stock dev box and is **not** what `winget install Microsoft.WinDbg` installs (that is the MSIX Store app `WinDbgX` — no headless console driver). Install recipe + verified invocation: § Installing cdb (Debugging Tools for Windows) below.

- **No-debugger fallback** — when no `cdb`/WinDbg/`kd` is on the box, run the dependency-free triage wrapper, which extracts the exception record (code + faulting address + crashing thread) and the loaded-module list, and attributes the faulting address to a module:

  ```
  bash agents/scripts/core/dump-triage.sh <dump.dmp>      # or no arg = newest under %LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps
  bash agents/scripts/core/dump-triage.sh --selftest       # fixture self-check
  ```

  It is fast but lossy (no symbol resolution) — use it to classify the fault (e.g. `0xC0000005` AV in which module) before deciding whether a full `cdb` session is warranted. Underlying scanner: `agents/scripts/core/minidump-triage.py`.

## Installing cdb (Debugging Tools for Windows)

`cdb.exe` is the headless console debugger — the only tool in this doc that is **not** on a stock dev box. Check before assuming one is present:

```
ls "C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/Debuggers/x64/cdb.exe"
```

A `Windows Kits\10` tree with **no `Debuggers\` subdir** is the normal state after a build-only SDK install: Debugging Tools is a separate SDK *feature*, off by default. `winget install Microsoft.WinDbg` does not fix it — that installs the `WinDbgX` Store app under an ACL-restricted `WindowsApps` path, off `PATH`, leaving no invocable `cdb`. (Hand-extracting `amd64/cdb.exe` from the `windbg.msixbundle` is a *different* operation and may work — `docs/guides/crash-capture.md` § Get the PRIMARY faulting stack carries it as an unverified no-admin fallback. If you confirm it, record the result here.)

> **Requires an interactive UAC prompt.** Step 2 below is the one step in this document an agent cannot perform unattended — `winsdksetup.exe` elevates, and elevation cannot be granted from git-bash. An autonomous run must **stop and ask a human** rather than retrying, or fall back to `dump-triage.sh` (§ Dump triage) for an unsymbolized classification.

Verified install (Windows 11 26200, cdb 10.0.26100.7705) — needs **admin/UAC**, ~2 min, no reboot. Commands are bash (git-bash); `\` line-continuations are POSIX, not `cmd`/PowerShell:

```
# 1. fetch the SDK bootstrapper — winget verifies the publisher SHA256,
#    which a bare download.microsoft.com URL does not
# (--id pins the SDK build verified below; if winget reports no such package,
#  `winget search Microsoft.WindowsSDK` for the current one — the /features
#  flag in step 2 is what matters and is stable across SDK builds)
winget download --id Microsoft.WindowsSDK.10.0.26100 --exact \
    --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements -d "<scratch>/sdk"

# 2. install ONLY the debuggers feature (run elevated)
"<scratch>/sdk/winsdksetup.exe" /features OptionId.WindowsDesktopDebuggers \
    /quiet /norestart /ceip off /log "<scratch>/sdk-install.log"
```

`/features OptionId.WindowsDesktopDebuggers` is what keeps this from being a multi-GB full-SDK install. Result: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\` holding `cdb.exe`, `windbg.exe`, `kd.exe`, `ntsd.exe`, `dumpchk.exe`, `symchk.exe`, `gflags.exe`, `umdh.exe`. It is **not** added to `PATH` — invoke by absolute path.

### Canonical one-shot

```
"C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/Debuggers/x64/cdb.exe" \
    -z <dump.dmp> \
    -y "<build-dir>;srv*<symcache>*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols" \
    -i "<build-dir>" -logo <out.log> \
    -c ".symopt+0x40; .reload /f; vertarget; !analyze -v; .echo ===ALLSTACKS===; ~*kb; q"
```

- `-y` with the **build dir first** — the locally-built `.pdb` must win over the symbol server.
- `-i` is the executable search path, so cdb can pair the dump's module list back to the exe.
- `.symopt+0x40` (`SYMOPT_LOAD_ANYTHING`) tolerates the benign `WARNING: Unable to verify checksum for <app>.exe` that a locally-linked build produces.
- `~*kb` walks **every** thread; `!analyze -v` alone only walks the faulting one — a hang dump needs both.
- `-logo` because useful output runs 70 KB+; read the log file rather than scrolling stdout.

The exe and its `.pdb` must be the **same build** as the dump — compare both mtimes against the dump before trusting any frame (§ Exe staleness check applies to symbols too).

### Known limits (not defects)

- **Third-party modules resolve only to `module!Export+0xNNN`.** The NVIDIA display DLLs (`nvwgf2umx`, `nvldumdx`, `nvgpucomp64`, `NvMemMapStoragex`, `nvspcap64`, `nvppex`) plus `VCRUNTIME140_1` and `directxdatabasehelper` publish no PDBs to msdl, so `.reload /f` reports "The system cannot find the file specified" for them. First-party frames are unaffected.
- **The capture thread's own stack is degenerate** in a `debug.dump_self` dump: the thread that called `MiniDumpWriteDump` shows ~3 frames topped by `ntdll!NtGetContextThread` and then garbage, because dbghelp snapshots its own caller mid-syscall. Immaterial — that is by definition not the thread under diagnosis, and it is a positive marker for *which* thread served the command.
- **The symbol cache grows fast** (≈375 MB for one session). Point the `srv*` leg at a durable path, not a per-session scratch dir, or every run re-downloads.
