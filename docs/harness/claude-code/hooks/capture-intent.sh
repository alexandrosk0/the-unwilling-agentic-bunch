# UserPromptSubmit hook — capture the user's prompt as a redacted one-liner.
#
# Persists a single safe line per prompt into a gitignored, branch-keyed capture
# file (.session-intent/<branch>.log). The ship-loop orchestrator reads that file
# at `gh pr create` time to synthesise the PR `## Intent` section (traceability:
# human ask -> diff). See docs/agent-rules/ship-loops.md § Intent capture.
#
# SECURITY / CONTRACT:
#   * UserPromptSubmit stdout is injected into the model's context. This hook must
#     therefore print NOTHING to stdout — it is a pure side-effect writer.
#   * The raw prompt may carry secrets / home-dir usernames. It is ALWAYS routed
#     through agents/scripts/core/redact-intent.py first. FAIL-SAFE: if the
#     redactor is unavailable or errors, the hook writes NOTHING (never the raw
#     prompt) and still exits 0 — capture is best-effort, never a leak and never
#     a block on prompt submission.
