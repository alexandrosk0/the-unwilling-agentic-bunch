# PreToolUse hook: mechanically enforce the fleet-preflight § Pre-launch checklist
# on a `Workflow` fan-out (docs/agent-rules/workflow-fleets.md). The orchestrator
# MUST run `fleet-preflight.sh --strict` before any fan-out above 2 agents
# (tooling.md `fleet-preflight-not-enforced-at-launch`, option (a) shipped #1354).
# This hook is option (b): the stronger, can't-forget enforcement — it runs the
# preflight on the Workflow tool's inline `script` (or `scriptPath`) and BLOCKS a
# launch that carries a hard violation (an unpinned multi-agent fan-out — the
# TPM-starvation death this whole gate was written from).
#
# Opt-in: this hook only fires when a `PreToolUse` matcher for `Workflow` is wired
# into settings.json (docs/harness/claude-code/settings.json.tmpl). `.claude/` is
# a gitignored re-sync; the template here is what survives commit. It alters
# behaviour for every session, hence the explicit settings opt-in.
#
# Threshold + downgrade envs (production leaves all unset → block-on-hard-violation
# for fan-outs above 2 agents):
#   SMATCHET_FLEET_PREFLIGHT_HOOK=0          fully disable (no-op, exit 0).
#   SMATCHET_FLEET_PREFLIGHT_HOOK_BLOCK=0    downgrade block → advisory (warn to
#                                            stderr, exit 0). Default 1 (block).
#   SMATCHET_FLEET_PREFLIGHT_HOOK_MIN_AGENTS only block when the script's agent()
#                                            count EXCEEDS this (default 2 — the
#                                            documented ">2 agents" MUST). A 1–2
#                                            agent helper is never blocked.
#
# FAIL-OPEN by design: a guard that blocks every Workflow when jq is missing / the
# preflight script is absent / the payload has no inline script would be worse
# than the gap it closes. Each of those exits 0 (allow) with a stderr note. The
# only non-zero exit is a CONFIRMED hard violation in an above-threshold fan-out.
#
# PreToolUse protocol: tool-input JSON on stdin; exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = block
# (stderr is surfaced to the session as the block reason).
