# Claude Code wrapper — runs scripts/dev/pillar2-scan.sh on each file in the
# deferred-lint drain chunk. Sourced from lint-cpp-drain.sh after the cppcheck
# pass. Thin shim by design — the actual scan logic lives at
# scripts/dev/pillar2-scan.sh so it's harness-agnostic (Codex / Cursor invoke
# the same canonical script via their own mechanisms; see
# docs/harness/<harness>/hooks-equivalent.md).
