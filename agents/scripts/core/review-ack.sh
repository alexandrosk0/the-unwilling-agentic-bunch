# review-ack.sh — record / check the code-review acknowledgement for a diff.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The commit-time half of docs/agent-rules/process-rules.md § Code-review before
# every commit. `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` refuses a SUBSTANTIVE staged C++
# diff whose fingerprint is not acknowledged here; the reviewer records the ack
# after running the `code-review` agent / adversarial-code-review skill:
#
#     bash agents/scripts/core/review-ack.sh --record --staged
#
# This is deliberately separate from `scripts/dev/pre-ship.sh --ack-review`,
# which records the same kind of ack for the PUSH gate but first runs the whole
# lint suite (clang-format, delta lint, markdown, doc-validation) — far too slow
# to sit in front of every commit. Both share agents/scripts/core/lib/review-ack.sh,
# so there is exactly one fingerprint implementation.
#
# Recording an ack you did not earn defeats the gate: the fingerprint proves the
# diff has not changed since SOMETHING was acknowledged, never that a review ran.
#
# Usage:
#   bash agents/scripts/core/review-ack.sh --record [--staged|--branch] [<base-ref>]
#   bash agents/scripts/core/review-ack.sh --check  [--staged|--branch] [<base-ref>]
#   bash agents/scripts/core/review-ack.sh --selftest
#   bash agents/scripts/core/review-ack.sh --help
#
# Modes: --staged (the index — the commit gate, default) · --branch (<base>...HEAD
# plus the working tree — the push gate). <base-ref> defaults to origin/develop
# and is ignored by --staged.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — ack recorded, or (--check) the diff is acked / not substantive.
#   1 — (--check) a substantive diff has no current ack.
#   2 — usage error, or not inside a git work tree.
#
# selftest: asserts-failure

review-ack.sh — record / check the code-review ack that gates a commit.

  bash agents/scripts/core/review-ack.sh --record [--staged|--branch] [<base-ref>]
  bash agents/scripts/core/review-ack.sh --check  [--staged|--branch] [<base-ref>]
  bash agents/scripts/core/review-ack.sh --selftest
  bash agents/scripts/core/review-ack.sh --help

Record the ack ONLY after actually running the code-review pass on that diff
(docs/agent-rules/process-rules.md § Code-review before every commit). Any later
edit changes the fingerprint and re-arms the gate.

Modes:  --staged  the index — what `git commit` will land (default)
        --branch  <base-ref>...HEAD plus the working tree — the push gate

Bypass for the commit gate (logged, discouraged): SMATCHET_SKIP_REVIEW_GATE=1
