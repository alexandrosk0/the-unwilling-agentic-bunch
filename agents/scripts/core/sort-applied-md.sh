# agents/scripts/core/sort-applied-md.sh — restore "Latest first" ordering on
# applied.md after a `merge=union` driver concatenation interleaves dates.
#
# Companion to the `merge=union` driver in `.gitattributes` (per
# docs/agent-rules/process-rules.md § Backlog-archive union merge). The driver
# concatenates parallel prepends verbatim — date order may interleave on the
# merge commit. This script re-sorts entries by their YYYY-MM-DD prefix
# descending while preserving:
#   - the file header (lines before the first entry)
#   - each entry's multi-line block (Resolution lines after the title)
#   - blank-line separators between entries
#
# Usage:
#   bash agents/scripts/core/sort-applied-md.sh
#   bash agents/scripts/core/sort-applied-md.sh --check    # exit 1 if reorder needed
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — applied.md sorted (or already sorted in --check)
#   1 — --check mode, file is out of order; OR Python parse error propagated
#       via `set -e` (cannot distinguish — both surface as exit 1)
#   2 — file not found

# applied.md is HOST content and stays host-side permanently — it is the
# merge=union entries file (grill decision 4), and this script is its repair
# tool: a LAYER script reading a HOST path (plan row 7b names the pair). The
# `cd` climb that used to anchor it lands in the layer post-flip, where the file
# does not exist, so the path is anchored on $PROJECT_ROOT instead. cwd is now
# the host tree for the same reason.
