# lock-release-p4.sh — release a plan-lock held via the Perforce counter
# backend. Sibling of `lock-release.sh` (git-ref backend).
#
# CAS-release: `p4 counter --from=1 --to=0 smatchet_lock_<slug>`. Server
# rejects the update if the counter isn't 1, so accidental release of a
# lock we don't own is a hard error rather than a silent corruption.
# Idempotent for the "already released" case: counter == 0 returns success
# with a notice (matches the git-ref release semantics).
#
# After successfully zeroing the state counter, the metadata counter
# `smatchet_lock_<slug>_meta` is best-effort deleted so a subsequent claim
# doesn't see a stale owner record while in the "released, not yet
# re-claimed" window.
#
# Phase 4 of `docs/plans/shipped/git-to-perforce-migration.md`.
#
# Usage:
#   bash agents/scripts/core/lock-release-p4.sh <slug>
#
# Required environment:
#   P4PORT, P4USER
#
# Optional environment:
#   P4_BIN           — p4 executable (default: `p4`)
#   P4_LOCK_PREFIX   — counter-name prefix (default: smatchet_lock_)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — counter set to 0 (or already 0); metadata cleared
#   2 — argument / environment error
#   3 — counter is in some other state (not 0 or 1) — manual fix needed
