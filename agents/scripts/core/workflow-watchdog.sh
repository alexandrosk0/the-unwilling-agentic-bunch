# workflow-watchdog.sh — classify a background Workflow fleet as progressing /
# crawl / frozen, per docs/agent-rules/workflow-fleets.md § Stall watchdog. A
# "stalled" fleet has two opposite causes with opposite remedies — crawl (TPM
# starvation: work still landing slowly → reduce concurrency, do NOT kill) vs
# frozen (permission prompt or agent death: newest transcript static ≥ ~10 min →
# kill + salvage). This automates the by-hand transcript-mtime archaeology that
# the 2026-06-10/11 audit-fleet salvage waves needed mid-incident.
#
# READ-ONLY. Never kills, never edits a fleet — it polls + classifies + (optional)
# nudges. The only file it writes is its own cross-poll state baseline.
#
# Usage:
#   workflow-watchdog.sh <fleet-slug> [--nudge]
#
#   <fleet-slug>  names build/<slug>/results (deliverable count) + the state file.
#   --nudge       SessionStart-formatted block, emitted ONLY when frozen (silent
#                 otherwise). Default mode prints a one-line verdict every poll.
#
# Verdict (needs two polls to tell crawl from frozen — a single sample cannot
# show "advancing"; the first poll establishes the baseline and leans crawl):
#   cascade victims ≥ MAX_CASCADE_VICTIMS     → cascade      (restart churn, OVERRIDES)
#   age ≤ FRESH_SECS                          → progressing (transcript just touched)
#   else, count or newest-mtime grew vs prev  → crawl       (work still landing)
#   else, age ≥ FROZEN_SECS                   → frozen      (static, nothing new)
#   else                                      → crawl       (uncertain → don't kill)
#
# CASCADE is a THIRD failure the mtime/count signals miss: a compacted subagent
# is auto-restarted onto the SAME oversized scope, re-compacts, and restarts again
# — 2.6× run amplification that never converges (run wf_62807bcd-dc8: 35/74
# transcripts ended compacted+interrupted, 9/14 lanes done in 40 min). Its remedy
# is OPPOSITE to crawl/frozen: not "reduce concurrency", not "kill+salvage", but
# ABORT + RE-SCOPE the churning lane (smaller model / tighter file list / windowed
# reads) so it stops re-crossing the compact threshold. A transcript is a cascade
# VICTIM when it carries BOTH `"isCompactSummary":true` AND a "[Request interrupted
# by user]" marker — the compact→interrupt→restart signature. Cascade can co-occur
# with progressing (some lanes land while others churn), so it OVERRIDES the verdict
# when the victim count crosses the threshold — it is the actionable signal.
#
# Test seams (production leaves all unset → identical behaviour):
#   WATCHDOG_RESULTS_DIR       deliverable dir (default build/<slug>/results).
#   WATCHDOG_TRANSCRIPT_DIR    agent-transcript root (default $HOME/.claude/projects).
#   WATCHDOG_STATE_FILE        cross-poll baseline (default build/<slug>/.watchdog-state).
#   WATCHDOG_FRESH_SECS        progressing threshold (default 120).
#   WATCHDOG_FROZEN_SECS       frozen threshold (default 600 = ~10 min).
#   WATCHDOG_MAX_CASCADE_VICTIMS  cascade trigger (default 3; --max-cascade-victims N).
#   WATCHDOG_CASCADE_WINDOW_SECS  victim-recency window (default 1800 = 30 min);
#                              only victims modified within it count, so a stale
#                              incident in the shared history can't force cascade.
#   WATCHDOG_NOW               "now" epoch seconds (default `date +%s`).
#
# GNU find (`-printf '%T@'`) is required for transcript mtimes — present in Git
# Bash / Linux CI where the bats gate runs.
