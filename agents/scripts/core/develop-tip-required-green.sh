# develop-tip-required-green.sh — SessionStart nudge when the `develop` TIP has a
# check that is NOT green. Two failure classes, both surfaced:
#
#   REQUIRED red — under block-on-any-red it silently blocks EVERY open PR (each
#   PR inherits develop's red onto its own head); otherwise discovered only when
#   the next author opens a PR and trips over it, mis-attributed to their change
#   (postmortems.md § 2026-07-10 · PR #1698).
#
#   NON-REQUIRED red — post-merge backstop jobs (installer smokes, LTO publish
#   builds) are the ONLY coverage for what PR checks structurally cannot run; a
#   red there blocks nothing, which is exactly how it hides. #1957's installer
#   smokes sat red on develop across three merges (second occurrence of the
#   class — infra/2026-08-05 entry), so the sweep covers required and
#   non-required alike, matching the merge-gate block-on-any-red philosophy.
#   Checks whose NAME marks them advisory are excluded, same as merge-gates.sh.
#
#   CANCELLED is reported as its own why-wording ("result unknown"), not lumped
#   with terminal failures: a develop run cancelled by a superseding push is
#   precisely how #1957's red never announced itself — unknown is NOT green.
#
# (File name kept from the required-only v1 — the SessionStart hook in
# docs/harness/claude-code/settings.json.tmpl references it by path.)
#
# Modes:
#   --nudge (default)  SILENT unless a check on the develop tip is not green
#                      (required or non-required; cancelled counts as unknown-
#                      not-green); then print a short attributable block.
#                      Never blocks (exit 0).
#   --selftest         fixture-driven test of the pure not-green detector; exit 0/1.
#
# Data layer is injectable for the selftest (no live gh needed):
#   SMATCHET_DEVTIP_REQUIRED_FIXTURE   — file: one required check-name per line.
#   SMATCHET_DEVTIP_CHECKRUNS_FIXTURE  — file: `<name>\t<status>\t<conclusion>` rows
#                                        (latest run per name; newest last wins).
#   SMATCHET_DEVTIP_SHA / _PRHINT      — override the reported tip sha / PR hint.
#
# gh / network absent → degrades to SILENT exit 0 (never wedges SessionStart).
#
# selftest: asserts-failure

set -uo pipefail

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pure detector: given the required-check names and the tip's latest per-check
# (status<TAB>conclusion) rows, print each NOT-GREEN check on the tip as
# tab-separated `name<TAB>kind<TAB>why` (kind: required|non-required|unknown).
# Tab, not '|': the widened sweep feeds arbitrary workflow job names through
# this record, and a job name may legally contain '|' — it cannot contain a tab
# (the TSV pipeline upstream would already have split it). Empty output = all
# green.
#
# kind=unknown: the caller could not obtain the required set (no branch
# protection visible to this token, or a transient fetch failure — the two are
# indistinguishable here). The sweep still runs — going silent instead was the
# v2 behavior, and it made the nudge permanently blind on any checkout whose
# token cannot read branch protection, defeating the #1957 widening exactly
# where it matters; "unknown" reports the red without guessing its blast
# radius.
#
# NOT-GREEN = the check's latest run on the tip is COMPLETED with a conclusion
# other than success/neutral/skipped. CANCELLED gets its own why-wording —
# "result unknown", not a terminal verdict — because a run cancelled by a
# superseding push is how a real failure stays unannounced (#1957). A later
# re-run of the same check supersedes an earlier cancelled row (newest last
# wins), so a green re-run silences the earlier cancel.
#
# The sweep iterates the tip's ACTUAL check runs — required and non-required
# alike (block-on-any-red philosophy; non-required post-merge backstops are the
# only coverage for what PR checks cannot run). Checks whose name contains
# "advisory" (any case) are exempt ONLY when they are not required — true
# merge-gate parity (10-gate-filter.sh exempts advisory names from the
# allow-list arm, never from the required arm). A required check red on the
# tip blocks every open PR whatever its name says, so it is always reported;
# with kind=unknown the advisory name wins the exemption (can't prove it
# required, and advisory naming is the sanctioned non-blocking convention).
#
# A required check that is simply ABSENT from the tip is (still) NOT red: many
# required contexts are PR-only (Test-delta, Perf PR-fast, Coverage, CR finding
# gate, …) and legitimately never run on a direct develop push — treating
# absence as red false-fires on every session. An in-progress (non-terminal)
# run is also not red (don't nag mid-CI). Detecting a genuinely self-disabled
# required gate is postmortem-owed.sh's absence-present job, which carries the
# expected-present allow-list this script deliberately does not. No I/O —
# unit-testable.
