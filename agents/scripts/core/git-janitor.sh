# agents/scripts/core/git-janitor.sh — automate the deterministic post-merge cleanup steps.
#
# Wraps the manual flow at agents/core/git-janitor.md § Standard cleanup loop into a
# single command. Refuses to act on uncommitted user work; refuses to
# force-push; refuses to delete branches that aren't merged on GitHub.
#
# Usage:
#   bash agents/scripts/core/git-janitor.sh --post-merge <pr-number>
#
# What it does (post-merge mode):
#   1. Verify clean working tree (no uncommitted modifications outside
#      .fetchcontent-* / build/*).
#   2. Verify the PR is MERGED on GitHub (refuse if not).
#   3. fetch + prune remotes.
#   4. Switch to develop, fast-forward to origin/develop.
#   5. Delete the local PR branch (after GitHub remote-delete on squash-merge).
#   5.5. Backfill the merge-snapshot ledger row when the merge actor left none
#      (human/UI merges — merge-pipeline-02; verdict BACKFILLED, actor
#      git-janitor, age-capped via SMATCHET_JANITOR_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE_HOURS,
#      default 6h, 0 = uncapped; best-effort, never fails the cleanup).
#   6. Run `cmake --build --preset ninja-iter-msvc --target SmatchetStandalone SmatchetCore_DX12`
#      as the final regression gate.
#   7. Print a concise report.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — clean cleanup; dual-target build passed (or deferred: other live sessions).
#   1 — refused to act (uncommitted work, PR not merged, build failed).
#   2 — usage error / required tool missing.
#
# Env knobs (concurrent-session confinement, Step 3.5):
#   CLAUDE_SESSION_ID / SMATCHET_JANITOR_SELF_SESSION — caller's own session id,
#       excluded from the live-session count so the orchestrator never blocks itself.
#   SMATCHET_JANITOR_DEFER — unset/1 (default): hard-defer when another session is
#       live; 0: force cleanup anyway.

# ops rug-pull them (the documented multi-session collision). Count live
# entries in the per-tree registry, EXCLUDING the caller's own session
# (CLAUDE_SESSION_ID; override via SMATCHET_JANITOR_SELF_SESSION) so the
# autonomous ship-loop orchestrator that invoked this janitor never blocks
# itself. Hard-defer by DEFAULT when any OTHER session is live;
# SMATCHET_JANITOR_DEFER=0 forces cleanup anyway (legacy =1 still defers).
# Registry files are key=value lines (branch=/sha=/ppid=/ts=) named by session
# id (session-tree-banner.sh). See docs/agent-rules/process-rules.md

# Liveness + pruning use the shared authoritative-pid primitives in
# session-registry-lib.sh (sr_entry_is_live / sr_prune_dead_stale) — the same

# byte (DRY Quality Pillar) instead of re-deriving the now-superseded inline
# ts-OR-kill-0 shim that over-blocked on a just-exited sibling. If the lib is
# somehow absent the script degrades to a conservative fresh-ts-only count
# (never false-prunes a live session, never false-allows a HEAD-moving op).

# ---------- Step 5.5: merge-snapshot ledger backfill (ADR-0017) ---------------

# instant; a HUMAN/UI merge — or an automerge-arming session that died before
# the merge event — leaves a ledger hole (merge-pipeline-02). This janitor runs
# minutes after a merge, so it is the post-merge hook that closes the hole:
# when the just-cleaned PR has NO row for pr+mergeCommit, compose one from the
# live PR state (labels persist on merged PRs outside the watcher path; the
# rollup is minutes-fresh — strictly fresher than the SessionStart live
# fallback that otherwise covers the hole) and append it with verdict
# BACKFILLED + actor git-janitor. BACKFILLED (never GATES_PASSED) marks the row
# post-hoc-composed; the detector keys on redChecks/overrideLabels, which ARE
# captured (via safe-admin-merge.sh's shared projections). Age cap: a merge
# older than SMATCHET_JANITOR_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE_HOURS (default 6; 0 = uncapped)
# is LEFT AS A HOLE — ADR-0017: a stale line is worse than a hole, and an
# unparseable mergedAt fails closed to "too old". Best-effort throughout: no
# failure here ever fails the cleanup (the || invocation also suspends -e
# inside, so each parse degrades instead of aborting).
