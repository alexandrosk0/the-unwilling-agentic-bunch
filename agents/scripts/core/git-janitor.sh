# agents/scripts/core/git-janitor.sh — automate the deterministic post-merge cleanup steps.
#
# Wraps the manual flow at agents/core/git-janitor.md § Standard cleanup loop into a
# single command. Refuses to act on uncommitted user work; refuses to
# force-push; refuses to delete branches that aren't merged on GitHub.
#
# Usage:
#   bash agents/scripts/core/git-janitor.sh --post-merge <pr-number>
#
# What it does (post-merge mode):
#   1. Verify clean working tree (no uncommitted modifications outside
#      .fetchcontent-* / build/*).
#   2. Verify the PR is MERGED on GitHub (refuse if not).
#   3. fetch + prune remotes.
#   4. Switch to develop, fast-forward to origin/develop.
#   5. Delete the local PR branch (after GitHub remote-delete on squash-merge).
#   6. Run `cmake --build --preset ninja-iter-msvc --target SmatchetStandalone SmatchetCore_DX12`
#      as the final regression gate.
#   7. Print a concise report.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — clean cleanup; dual-target build passed.
#   1 — refused to act (uncommitted work, PR not merged, build failed).
#   2 — usage error / required tool missing.
