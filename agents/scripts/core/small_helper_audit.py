"""Small-helper clone census for the gate-blind-spot-sweep Slice 2 gate.

Sibling of dup_audit.py — and deliberately NOT a replacement for it. dup_audit.py's
`MIN_CLONE_TOKENS = 70` (~8 lines of C++) is what makes the blocking DRY gate viable: dropping the
floor to ~15 would flood it with every `if (!x) return false;` in the tree and destroy the signal.
So small-helper duplication is invisible to Pillar 5 **by construction**, and the grandfathered
449-clone baseline can never surface it.

This audit asks a DIFFERENT question with a DIFFERENT tool, in the band dup_audit.py cannot enter:

    "is the same small NAMED helper re-rolled, body-for-body, in three or more TUs?"

Three narrowings make that answerable without the noise that lowering MIN_CLONE_TOKENS would cause:

  1. **Named free functions only.** The unit is a function definition — its parameter list and body
     — never an arbitrary token run. A repeated `if (!x) return false;` inside three unrelated
     functions is not a finding here; three functions that ARE that body are.
  2. **Exact normalised match.** Parameter + body token streams are normalized with dup_audit's own
     `normalize_token` (identifiers -> ID, literals -> LIT, keywords + punctuation structural), so a
     copy-then-rename still collides while a genuine structural edit diverges. No fuzzy / shingled
     matching — this reports identity, not similarity.
  3. **>= MIN_TU_SPREAD distinct TUs.** Two files sharing a helper is a pair; three or more is a
     pattern, and a pattern is what justifies a shared Core helper. The spread requirement is what
     keeps the SUB-floor band quiet enough to read.

Band: HELPER_MIN_TOKENS <= body tokens < dup_audit.MIN_CLONE_TOKENS. The upper bound is imported,
not copied, so the two audits can never drift into overlapping or leaving a gap between them.

Verdict model — ADVISORY (WARN-first), mirroring the DRY gate's pre-graduation posture
(docs/adr/0015-dry-quality-pillar-duplication-gate.md) and the sibling dead_export_audit.py.
`--check` prints `[small-helper] WARN ...` for non-baselined groups and exits 0.

Accepted blind spots (floor, not ceiling):
  * Out-of-line MEMBER definitions (`Foo::Bar(...) {`) are skipped — the plan scopes this to free
    helpers, and a member's body is bound to its class's state.
  * A free function returning a RAW POINTER (`char* Foo(...)`) is skipped: the token immediately
    before the name is `*`, which `_NOT_A_DECLARATOR_PREFIX` treats as "not a declarator" so a
    multiplication expression like `a * Foo(b)` is not mis-read as a definition. Reference returns
    (`int& Foo(...)`) are unaffected — `&` is deliberately absent from that set. Under-counts only,
    never over-counts, which is the safe direction for an advisory census.
  * A helper re-rolled with a genuinely different body (e.g. an explicit `'A'..'Z'` branch instead
    of `std::tolower`) does NOT group with the std::tolower family. That is correct: they are not
    the same function, and merging them would be a behaviour change, not a de-duplication.
  * Template definitions are included, but a body differing only in a dependent type collapses to
    ID under normalization and may group — read the report, do not merge blind.

Modes mirror dup_audit.py so test-gate-selftests.sh + the workflow wiring need no special-casing:

  small_helper_audit.py                 # human report of current sub-floor helper clone groups
  small_helper_audit.py --list          # one `rule<TAB>hash<TAB>file:line<TAB>Name` per member
  small_helper_audit.py --baseline-md   # deterministic markdown grandfather snapshot
  small_helper_audit.py --check         # ADVISORY gate: `[small-helper] WARN ...` for NEW groups
  small_helper_audit.py --selftest      # assert the extractor + banding + spread invariants hold

Exit contract (so the shell wrapper can fail CLOSED on infra): 0 = clean / advisory WARN only,
1 = reserved for the post-graduation blocking verdict, >=2 = infra error (main wraps -> exit 2).
