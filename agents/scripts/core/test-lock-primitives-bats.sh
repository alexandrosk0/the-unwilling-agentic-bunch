# test-lock-primitives-bats.sh — bats wrapper for tests/bats/lock_*.bats.
#
# Bucket A (CLI) per AGENTS.md § Verification automation. Zero manual steps.
# Auto-enrolled by scripts/dev/test-all.sh via the test-*.sh glob.
#
# Per docs/reference/agentic-infrastructure-2026-05-23.md punch-list item 6
# (bats coverage for lock primitives). Complementary to the existing
# agents/scripts/core/test-lock-primitives.sh integration test — bats gives
# per-case isolation so an argument-validation regression doesn't poison
# the whole end-to-end run.
#
# Exit codes follow the test-author convention:
#   0 — every bats test passed
#   1 — at least one bats test failed
#   2 — bats binary missing (BUILD.md § Dev-script CLI tools lists the install)
