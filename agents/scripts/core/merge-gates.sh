# Merge-gates poller for the orchestrator + git-janitor ship-loop.
#
# Polls four conditions on a PR via one `gh api graphql` call:
#   1. CI — every required check passes (CheckRun terminal SUCCESS/NEUTRAL/SKIPPED;
#      StatusContext state == SUCCESS) PLUS every non-required check whose name
#      does not contain "advisory" (block-on-any-red; the all-gates-blocking
#      flip of the former curated allow-list) — see $failing below +
#      postmortems.md 2026-06-06 "#923".
#   2. CodeRabbit — latest review on current headRefOid is not CHANGES_REQUESTED;
#      zero unresolved non-outdated review threads contain a CodeRabbit comment.
#      A CR rate-limit skip (TEMPORARY, distinct from a terminal "Review skipped")
#      auto-downgrades to WARN on a PURE-DOCS PR (no label) but PAUSES a CODE PR
#      for CR re-review (PR-2). See the rate-limit handling block + the
#      cr-disposition label note below.
#   3. User comments — zero unresolved non-outdated review threads with any
#      non-bot non-self comment; zero conversation-tab comments from non-bot
#      non-self authors
#   4. Cursor Bugbot (cursor[bot]) — zero unresolved non-outdated review threads
#      authored by cursor[bot] (its line-anchored findings). Bugbot summary
#      reviews are always COMMENTED, so the gate guards on open findings only;
#      a "couldn't run"/"usage limit" status comment, a silent Bugbot, or a
#      stale prior-commit review never wedge merge (no-wedge + grace hatches).
#
# Plus: pullRequest.state == OPEN, reviewDecision in {APPROVED, null},
# all connection pageInfo.hasNextPage == false.
#
# Rollup dedup: required CheckRuns with the same `.name` are deduped to the
# entry with the latest `.startedAt` so stale FAILUREs from rerun jobs don't
# falsely block. StatusContexts are deduped by `.context` (GitHub overwrites).
#
# Per-PR label overrides (AGENTS.md § Merge gates § Per-PR overrides):
#   tests-out-of-band → downgrades `Test-delta gate` FAIL → WARN
#   perf-out-of-band  → downgrades `Perf PR-fast (...)` FAIL → WARN
#   intent-out-of-band → downgrades `Intent section` FAIL → WARN
#   plan-lock-out-of-band → downgrades `Plan-lock gate` FAIL → WARN
#   cr-out-of-band    → downgrades a CodeRabbit block → WARN (CR gate only;
#                       CI + user-comment gates still bind). REQUIRES a paired
#                       `cr-disposition:<reason>` attestation (label OR PR-body
#                       marker) — cr-out-of-band ALONE is NOT honoured (PR-3
#                       cr-out-of-band-disposition-trail). The CR rate-limit skip
#                       on a CODE PR is the original case of this rule (PR-2
#                       cr-rate-limit-code-pr-auto-pause).
#   cr-disposition:*  → operator attestation (a `cr-disposition:`-prefixed label
#                       OR a `cr-disposition:<reason>` marker line in the PR body)
#                       paired with cr-out-of-band to record WHY CR review was
#                       waived. Mandatory for every cr-out-of-band downgrade.
#   bugbot-out-of-band → downgrades a Cursor Bugbot block → WARN (Bugbot gate
#                       only; CI + CR + user-comment gates still bind)
# Downgraded failures are logged on stderr but do NOT contribute to ci_fail
# (CI downgrades) / do NOT block the CR gate (cr-out-of-band) / do NOT block
# the Bugbot gate (bugbot-out-of-band).
#
# Auto-exemption (NO label): a PR whose diff is ENTIRELY under
# docs/self-improvement/** (the agent system's own backlog / postmortem ledger)
# auto-skips the CR (#2) + Bugbot (#4) gates — CR via the .coderabbit.yaml
# path_filter ("Review skipped" fast-pass) plus a belt-and-suspenders downgrade
# here, Bugbot via the $selfImpOnly tuple field (27). CI (#1) + user-comment (#3)
# gates still bind. This stops the bots *blocking* merge; stopping Bugbot from
# *posting* needs a Cursor-dashboard path-ignore (no in-repo Bugbot config). See
# plan docs/plans/self-improvement-pr-review-exemption.md.

# Env knobs:
#   ORCH_USER                    — orchestrator GitHub login (required)
#   MERGE_GATES_POLL_INTERVAL    — seconds between polls (default 60)
#   MERGE_GATES_MAX_POLLS        — max poll count (default 90; raised from 60 at the all-gates-blocking flip — the pending-hold now spans every lane incl. the 45-min bucket-E cap)
#   MERGE_GATES_TIMEOUT_SECONDS  — wall-clock budget (default derives from MAX_POLLS x POLL_INTERVAL, i.e. 5400 at the 90x60 defaults, so the two knobs can't cap each other)
#   MERGE_GATES_QUERY_FILE       — override GraphQL document path
#   MERGE_GATES_FLIP_READY       — when "true", flip PR ready-for-review at
#                                  poll start (authorized-merge callers only)
#   MERGE_GATES_REQUIRED_CONTEXTS — override the branch-protection required-context
#                                  set (newline- or comma-separated names). When
#                                  set (even to ""), bypasses the project.config.json

#                                  inert. Used by tests to inject a fixture-matching
#                                  set; operationally rarely needed.
#   MERGE_GATES_CONFIG_FILE      — override path to project.config.json for the
#                                  required-context read (default: repo-root config).
#   MERGE_GATES_IGNORE_MERGESTATE — when "true", skip the mergeStateStatus guard so
#                                  GATES_PASSED is NOT refused on BLOCKED/BEHIND.
#                                  Default unset/false → enforce the block. Set true

#   MERGE_GATES_PRIOR_STALE_STREAK  Set by smatchet-merge-watcher (which persists

# Meant-to-block scope — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
# BLOCK-ON-ANY-RED (all-gates-blocking flip): the regex matches EVERY check
# name, so any non-required check that reaches a failing terminal state blocks
# the merge exactly like a required one, and any still-pending check holds
# GATES_PASSED. This is the mechanised form of the AGENTS.md invariant
# "Never merge past ANY red check — required or not" (previously curated:
# Coverage|Sanitizer|Perf PR-fast|Android security gate|Fuzz smoke|
# Bucket launch-smoke|Intent section|Plan-lock gate, grown one #923-class
# gate-escape at a time — this flip retires the curation).
# The ONE remaining exemption is the `advisory`-NAME exclusion in the jq below:
# a check whose name literally contains "advisory" does not block. After the
# all-gates-blocking rename sweep NO lane carries that token; it survives as the
# sanctioned, name-visible convention for any future deliberately-advisory lane
# (an invisible poller-side list is exactly what this flip removes).
# Prereqs that made block-all safe (each lane genuinely green first):
#  * emulator smoke — cold-boot fix removed the ~23% snapshot-restore boot race;
#  * Android NDK — httplib zstd auto-detect pinned OFF (#1604, hermetic);
#  * fuzz smoke — the stochastic fuzz STEP stays continue-on-error on PRs
#    (#1301 design) so only the deterministic build/ctest reds the check;
#  * bucket-C — the per-scenario golden-diff STEP stays advisory-by-design
#    (per-developer GPU goldens; lane-integrity + launch-smoke carry the teeth),
#    so the CHECK reds only on real infra/dead-harness breakage.
# Override hatches, unchanged: tests-/perf-/intent-/plan-lock-out-of-band labels
# downgrade their named checks; SKIP_MERGE_GATES=true is the global bypass.
# Other tooling applies the IDENTICAL scope by sourcing this file
# (safe-admin-merge.sh, postmortem-owed.sh) — change it HERE and every consumer
