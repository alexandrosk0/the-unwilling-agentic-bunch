# test-lock-primitives.sh — exercise lock-{claim,claim-update,release,show}.sh
# against a sandbox bare repo. Validates the atomic CAS contract end-to-end
# without touching the real origin remote.
#
# Auto-enrolled by scripts/dev/test-all.sh via the test-*.sh glob.
#
# Setup: creates two temp clones of a bare repo and runs the lock scripts
# from inside each clone. Sets SMATCHET_LOCK_BYPASS_REPO_CHECK=1 so the
# scripts accept a non-Smatchet sandbox URL.
#
# Cases:
#   1. claim succeeds for a new slug
#   2. concurrent claim from clone2 on same slug → REJECTED (lock held)
#   3. locks-show.sh lists the held slug
#   4. update from claim-holder succeeds
#   5. update from non-holder with stale lease → REJECTED
#   6. release deletes the ref, post-release ls-remote is empty
#   7. claim by previously-rejected actor now succeeds
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all cases passed
#   1 — one or more cases failed (details printed)
#   2 — sandbox setup failure

# Usage:

# conflict and retry, then fail when retries exhaust if clone-a keeps winning.

# lease against it after clone-a has moved the ref further.
