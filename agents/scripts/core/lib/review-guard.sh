# review-guard.sh — the review panel's write guard, as two pure functions.
# Port of Whip-Process Tools/review-guard.ps1; contract comments carried verbatim
# (docs/agent-rules/review-panels.md § Write-guard contracts binds this port).
#
# A review is a READ-ONLY pass that writes exactly one file (the leg's own
# review file). No harness can express that — every leg flag is all-or-nothing
# (a sandbox that blocks all writes blocks the review file too) — so the rule
# is CHECKED after the round rather than trusted to the harness.
#
# CONTRACT, deliberately narrow: the guard sees what `git status` sees. A path
# that git ignores is invisible to it. Widening to --ignored would drown the
# report in build artifacts; the guard's job is the tracked work product, which
# is what a review can actually corrupt.
#
# Shape (the PowerShell original returned hashtables; bash speaks in lines):
#   get_dirty_state <root>
#     stdout — one line per dirty path: "<path>\t<signature>", sorted by path
#     rc 0  — scan performed (zero lines = VERIFIED clean)
#     rc 1  — scan could NOT be performed (the original's $null; see below)
#   get_stray_paths <before-file> <after-file> <expected-file>
#     args  — files of get_dirty_state lines (expected-file: one path per line)
#     stdout — sorted unique stray paths
#
# Sourced by run-review.sh and the bats suite; no side effects at source time.

# get_dirty_state <root>
# Every dirty path (staged, unstaged, untracked) mapped to a content signature.
#
# Signature, not mere membership: a tree is routinely dirty mid-item, and
# keying on path names alone reports clean when a leg edits a file that was
# ALREADY dirty at launch — the guard's normal operating state, and so a
# false-clean exactly where it matters.
#
# Returns rc 1 when the scan could not be performed — NOT an empty set. The
# distinction is load-bearing: a guard that reports clean because git failed
# is worse than no guard: it fails OPEN in a safety check. Callers must treat
# rc 1 as unverified and say so.
