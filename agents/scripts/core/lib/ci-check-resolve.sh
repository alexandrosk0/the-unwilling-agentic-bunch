# ci-check-resolve.sh — shared name->workflow resolution library (sourced, not run).
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Given a GitHub check-name string (the rendered status-context name), resolve
# which `.github/workflows/*.yml` file + job emits it, and surface that job's
# `on.pull_request` trigger shape: whether the WORKFLOW carries a
# `paths:` / `paths-ignore:` filter on its `pull_request` event, and whether the
# job carries the documented self-gate marker comment.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Two CI gate-escape classes share one question — "given a check-name, which
#   workflow+job emits it and what are that job's PR triggers":
#     * required-context parity (test-required-context-parity.sh) — a REQUIRED
#       branch-protection context whose workflow is `paths:`-filtered deadlocks
#       every PR that misses those paths (the #880/#881/#882 wedge).
#     * (future) allow-list-present assertion (infra.md follow-up).
#   Build the map ONCE here; consumers source this file and call the API.
#
# NAME SHAPES GitHub renders for a job:
#   * `jobs.<id>.name: "Foo"`  -> the status context is "Foo".
#   * job with NO `name:`       -> the status context is the job id "<id>".
#   * templated `name: "Foo (${{ matrix.x }})"` -> flagged TEMPLATED; a concrete
#     required context matching the literal prefix (before the first `${{`)
#     resolves by prefix so a matrix-leg required context still resolves.
#
# PARSING: Python-only (`yaml.safe_load`) — no `yq` CI dependency. Python is
# already a hard dep (test-agent-contract.sh). The Windows python3 Store-alias
# stub passes `command -v` but exits 49 when run, so probe each candidate.
#
# SELF-GATE MARKER (the escape convention):
#   A job whose workflow legitimately runs unconditionally but internally
#   short-circuits (the #884 shape) carries the magic comment
#       # ci-required-context: self-gated
#   anywhere in that workflow file. The parity gate treats a self-gate-marked
#   context as parity-OK even if (hypothetically) a filter were present.
#
# API (source this file, then call):
#   ci_resolve_check "<check name>"
#       Emits one TAB-separated record to stdout and returns 0 on resolve:
#         <status>\t<workflow_file>\t<job_id>\t<pr_triggered>\t<has_pr_paths_filter>\t<self_gated>\t<templated>
#       <status> is RESOLVED or UNRESOLVABLE. On UNRESOLVABLE the remaining
#       fields are "-" and the return code is 1 (fail-closed: an unresolvable
#       required context is itself the deadlock risk).
#   ci_resolve_dump [<workflows_dir>]
#       Debug: emit every (check-name -> record) the map knows, one per line.
#
# ENV:
#   CI_WORKFLOWS_DIR   override the scanned dir (default .github/workflows);
#                      used by --selftest / bats to point at a fixture dir.
#
# This file is sourced; it defines functions + a $CI_RESOLVE_PY interpreter and
# does NOT `set -e` (the sourcing script owns shell options).
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Resolve a working python interpreter once (command -v alone is insufficient on
# Windows — the python3 Store-alias stub passes it but exits 49 when run). We
# PREFER an interpreter that can `import yaml` (the parser hard-requires PyYAML);
# only if none has yaml do we fall back to the first merely-runnable one (so the
# error surfaces as the clear "PyYAML not installed" message from the parser,
# not a confusing interpreter-missing error). On the msys2 UCRT64 box `python3`
# runs but lacks PyYAML while the Windows `python` has it — preferring the
# yaml-capable interpreter keeps a local `bash test-…parity.sh` working without
# a pip install, matching the CI behaviour where setup-python's python3 has it.
