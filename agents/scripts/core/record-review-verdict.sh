# record-review-verdict.sh — stamp the pre-push review-verdict marker for HEAD
# and print the head-bound PR-body verdict line.
#
# The review step of the [pre-first-push gate] leaves no trace, and a recorded
# verdict that names no commit survives pushes it never covered
# (review-verdict-not-bound-to-head, process 2026-08-13: one verdict rode
# through six review-fix pushes). This script is the single stamping point for
# both enforcement layers:
#   1. Prints `adversarial-code-review: <tail> (head=<sha>)` for the PR body —
#      CI (doc-validation.yml `Intent section`) rejects a body whose head= does
#      not match the PR head, so every push invalidates the prior verdict.
#   2. Writes `$GIT_DIR/review-verdict-<head-sha>` — the pre-push hook
#      (scripts/git-hooks/pre-push, section E) refuses to push a feature branch
#      whose HEAD carries no marker.
# Neither layer can prove the review RAN; they prove a claim was recorded for
# THIS commit, which makes a skipped or stale review visible instead of silent.
#
# Grammar validation alone left a hole a hand-written tail could walk through:
# `"n/a — <plausible reason>"` passes the checker with no review having run at
# all (PR #2219: a verdict was recorded purely to satisfy this gate, before any
# review tool had been invoked, on a diff substantive enough to warrant one).
# So for a SUBSTANTIVE diff (strict-zone touch, or >= REVIEW_LINE_THRESHOLD
# changed first-party C++ lines vs <base-ref> — the exact test
# scripts/dev/pre-ship.sh's push gate already applies) this script additionally
# requires a current, fingerprint-matching `.review-ack` + `.review-findings.json`
# pair before recording ANY tail, findings-form or "n/a" alike — the same
# machine-checkable proof `pre-ship.sh --ack-review` requires, reused via
# agents/scripts/core/lib/review-ack.sh rather than re-implemented here. A
# genuinely trivial diff (docs, comments, renames, non-C++, or first-party C++
# under the line threshold) is untouched: "n/a — <reason>" stays a one-liner,
# no artifact required. This is honest about its limit, same as the artifact
# check it reuses: it closes "recorded without reviewing", not a determined
# forgery of the artifact — see pre-ship.sh's own comment on that trade-off.
# Also honest that "substantive" is scoped to first-party C++ (RA_CPP_GLOBS,
# lib/review-ack.sh) — a diff touching ONLY this script / pre-ship.sh / other
# shell tooling is therefore never substantive under this rule, so the gate
# scripts editing their OWN enforcement are not (yet) forced through it either.
# Pre-existing scope, not something this change narrowed or widened.
#
# Usage:
#   bash record-review-verdict.sh "N findings, <disposition>" [<base-ref>]
#   bash record-review-verdict.sh "n/a — <reason>"            [<base-ref>]
#     # <base-ref> defaults to origin/develop (ra_is_substantive's default) —
#     # pass the SAME <base-ref> here as was used for `pre-ship.sh --ack-review`;
#     # a mismatch fingerprints a different diff and REFUSES as "no proof".
#   bash record-review-verdict.sh --selftest
#
# Exit: 0 = tail validated + marker written + line printed; 1 = tail rejected
# by the verdict grammar (unfilled placeholders included) OR a substantive diff
# has no matching review-ack/artifact pair; 2 = usage / not a git repo / no
# HEAD / the review-ack library is unreadable (infra, not a real gate result).
