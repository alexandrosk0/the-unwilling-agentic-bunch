#!/usr/bin/env bash
# lock-claim-update.sh — update an existing plan-lock claim (e.g. scope growth).
#
# Builds a new commit whose parent is the current `refs/locks/<slug>` tip,
# replaces `claim.json` with refreshed metadata, and pushes with
# `--force-with-lease` so the push fails if another actor mutated the ref
# between fetch and push (atomic compare-and-swap on the existing-ref case).
#
# Usage:
#   bash agents/scripts/core/lock-claim-update.sh <slug> <write-set-file>
#
# Arguments identical to lock-claim.sh. New write_set fully replaces the
# previous one; updated_at is bumped, started_at carries over from the
# original claim.
#
# Optional environment: same as lock-claim.sh, plus
#   LOCK_RETRY_MAX   — max lease-conflict retries (default 3)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — update pushed successfully
#   1 — lock does not exist; use lock-claim.sh first
#   2 — argument / environment / repo-state error
#   3 — lease conflict after retries (someone else keeps updating the ref)
#   4 — transient network failure after retries

# `SMATCHET_LOCK_BACKEND=p4-counter` has no claim-update equivalent today:
# `lock-claim-p4.sh` ships claim + release only (CAS via `p4 counter`).
# Update-in-place against an existing counter is feasible but unscoped; the
# safe interim behaviour is to refuse loudly so the caller routes around
# (release + re-claim) instead of silently dropping write-set growth.

lock-claim-update: not supported in the p4-counter backend.

The Perforce backend (lock-claim-p4.sh + lock-release-p4.sh) ships claim
+ release only. To grow an existing lock's write-set, run release then a
fresh claim:

    bash agents/scripts/core/lock-release.sh <slug>
    bash agents/scripts/core/lock-claim.sh <slug> <new-write-set-file>

Backlog: implement lock-claim-update-p4.sh as a follow-up. Filed in
docs/self-improvement/categories/tooling.md.
