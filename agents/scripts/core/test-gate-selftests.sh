# test-gate-selftests.sh — the gate that gates the gates (Gap C / close-gate-gaps Slice 3).
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Class of bug this kills (#918/#663/#784/#978): a gate whose `--selftest` only
# ever exercises the PASS path, so a silently-broken gate ships "green." A
# universal bad-input meta-gate is impossible (each gate's bad input is
# semantic), so this checks SHAPE, not semantics: every first-party script that
# EXPOSES a `--selftest` flag must ALSO carry a grep-able
#     # selftest: asserts-failure
# marker (a behaviour-inert comment) proving its selftest exercises at least one
# genuine failure case. The `: n/a — <reason>` form is accepted for the rare
# pure dispatcher with no failure mode to assert. A future gate physically
# cannot ship a pass-only selftest without tripping this.
#
# SCOPE: agents/scripts/{core,project}/ + scripts/dev/, first-party only.
#   "Exposes --selftest" = a real flag handler (a `--selftest)` case arm, a
#   `= "--selftest"` test, or an argparse/argv handler) — NOT a mere mention in
#   a comment or a manifest string (so test-docs.sh's STEPS manifest and
#   test-session-registry-bats.sh's doc comment are correctly NOT required to
#   carry the marker).
#
# Fail-CLOSED: a missing tool / unreadable file / no scripts found is an infra
# error (exit 2), never a silent pass.
#
# Modes:
#   (no args) | --check   scan the real tree; FAIL (1) listing every pass-only selftest.
#   --selftest            dogfood: synth a marker-less script -> assert FAIL; add
#                         the marker -> assert PASS. Asserts a failure case.
#
# Exit: 0 every exposer carries the marker · 1 a pass-only selftest · 2 infra error.
# Goes through test-shell-lint.sh (5 rules) + the shellcheck -S warning fail-set.
