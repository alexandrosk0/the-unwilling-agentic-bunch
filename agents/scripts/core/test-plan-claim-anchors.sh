# test-plan-claim-anchors.sh — a plan's § Deviations / § Implementation log may not
# assert that something ALREADY EXISTED without pointing at where.
#
# Why (plan-post-ship-claims-unverified, tooling P1): a shipped plan's closing
# prose is the only record of what actually landed, and nothing reads it.
# `msvc-build-onboarding-hardening.md:85` closed a row with "`build_standalone.ps1`
# (plan file 1) already had the MSVC bootstrap from slice 1" — when measured
# (2026-08-03), `git log -S vcvars` on that file was EMPTY across all history:
# the promised vcvars/vswhere import was never written, in any revision. (Dated
# deliberately — the file has since been deleted in the bash port, #1955, so the
# measurement is no longer reproducible verbatim; an undated restatement here
# would itself be the unanchored stale claim this gate polices.) The claim sat
# load-bearing for ~2 months and seeded a false premise into a downstream plan's
# § Context.
#
# Nothing contradicted it. § Verification (actual) listed 3/3 green, but all three
# cases test other behaviour, so a passing verification block is fully consistent
# with the capability being absent. And postmortem-owed.sh is structurally blind
# here: it reads MERGE signals (non-SUCCESS checks, override labels, Revert,
# overdue deviations), and an untrue sentence in a doc emits none. Detection has
# to happen at doc-gate time.
#
# This gate does NOT prove a claim true — nothing mechanical can. It forces the
# author to point at the code, and **there is no line to point at for a vcvars
# import that does not exist**, which is exactly where #495 would have stopped.
#
# Escape, for claims about state OUTSIDE the repo (branch-protection API,
# upstream releases) that genuinely have no file:line — e.g.
# solo-merge-review-gate.md:91 cites GitHub's `required_pull_request_reviews`:
#   <!-- SMATCHET_DEVIATION(rule=plan-claim-anchor; reason=…; owner=…; revisit=…) -->
# on the line ABOVE the claim, matching the lint-rules.d convention.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION, stated rather than implied: the `revisit=` date is NOT
# enforced here. The `deviation-overdue` lint that expires these markers scans
# first-party C++ only, so a markdown escape never expires. Zero plans carry the
# marker today, so nothing is currently unpoliced — but the first author to use
# it gets a permanent exemption wearing an expiry date, which is worse than no
# date at all. Extending deviation-overdue to markdown is the follow-up; do not
# read the field as a control until then.
#
# Scope modes:
#   default    — diff-scope: only claims on lines ADDED vs origin/develop.
#   --all      — whole tree, with pre-existing claims grandfathered in
#                docs/high-integrity/plan-claim-anchor-baseline.md.
#   --baseline — regenerate that baseline from the current tree, then commit it.
#   --selftest — fixture assertions on the classifier.
#
# Diff-scope is ADDED-LINE granular, deliberately unlike its sibling
# test-markdown-links.sh, which scopes to changed FILES. A dangling link in a file
# you touched is plausibly yours; a two-year-old claim sentence you scrolled past
# is not. The 25 grandfathered claims cluster (mobile-app-fuller-integration.md
# carries 3), so file granularity would fail authors for prose they did not write
# — and a gate that cries wolf on untouched lines gets escaped rather than obeyed.

    Stripping backticks is NOT sufficient on its own: test-markdown-links scans
    by regex and does not honour code spans, so a `[label](target)` anywhere in
    this file is a link to it however it is delimited. A space is inserted after
    the `]` — its LINK_RE requires `](` adjacent — which neuters the syntax while
    leaving the row readable.
