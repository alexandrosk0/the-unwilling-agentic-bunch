# merge-watcher-stuck-nudge.sh — SessionStart nudge for PRs the merge-watcher has
# escalated to STUCK_NEEDS_ATTENTION (see docs/plans/shipped/merge-watcher-stuck-
# escalation.md + merge-watcher.py maybe_escalate_stuck_pr). A wedged PR (merge
# conflict, behind base, CI-failing, or all-green-but-unresolved-threads) sits
# forever otherwise; this surfaces it so a human un-wedges it.
#
# Modes:
#   --list   (default) plain "stuck: PR #N — <reason> (<streak> cycles)" lines.
#   --nudge  SessionStart-formatted block (silent when nothing is stuck).
#
# Also detects daemon ABSENCE (merge-watcher-liveness-unmonitored, infra P2):
# the per-PR state files this script reads are written BY the daemon, so a
# daemon that never starts (or dies later) is silent by construction — with
# PRs registered, that silence means throughput stopped with no signal. When
# the registry is non-empty and the freshest daemon evidence (any per-PR
# last_poll_unix, or daemon.log mtime) is older than
# MERGE_WATCH_NUDGE_ABSENCE_GRACE_SECONDS (default 300 = 5 poll intervals) —
# or there is no evidence at all for a PR registered longer ago than that —
# a "daemon looks DEAD" nudge fires alongside any STUCK lines.
#
# Mirrors postmortem-owed.sh: deterministic read of the watcher state, no action.
# Advisory — never blocks. Exit 0 always (even without python; degrades silent).
