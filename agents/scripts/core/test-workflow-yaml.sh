# test-workflow-yaml.sh — smoke-test every `.github/workflows/*.yml` for
# YAML parse validity. Closes the regression class that hit PR #323 + #324
# where heredoc bodies at column 0 inside a `run: |` block scalar broke the
# whole workflow — visible as `gh run list --workflow=<name>.yml` showing
# completed/failure with zero jobs and no logs. (CodeRabbit PR #323 self-
# improvement note.)
#
# Auto-enrolled into scripts/dev/test-all.sh by the existing `test-*.sh`
# pattern. Exit 1 on any parse failure; exit 0 when all workflows parse.
