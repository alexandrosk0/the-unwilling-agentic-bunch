# postmortem-owed.sh — detect gate escapes on recent `develop` merges and nudge
# for a blameless postmortem (see docs/plans/shipped/gate-escape-postmortem.md +
# the gate-escape-postmortem skill). A gate escape = something shipped that a
# gate should have caught; the "gate, don't trust" response is a NEW gate, filed
# via the postmortem's mandatory `### Preventing gate` field.
#
# Triggers (an escape lacking a postmortems.md entry referencing its PR):
#   1. non-SUCCESS check on the merged head (PRIMARY) — a BLOCKING-scope check
#      whose LATEST run was terminal non-SUCCESS (FAILURE, or CANCELLED with no
#      later run) yet merged. The most common escape. "Blocking scope" +
#      "latest-run terminal" follow merge-gates.sh's curation (see CURATION
#      below) so a CANCELLED concurrency twin beside a later SUCCESS / advisory
#      lane / in-progress check never reads as a red required check.
#   2. override label on the merged PR (project.config.json
#      merge_gates.override_labels) — but ONLY when the override was
#      LOAD-BEARING (its gated check did not pass on its own). A moot override
#      (gate green anyway) owes no postmortem.
#   3. a `Revert` commit on develop (a post-merge undo).
#   4. a PR-less direct push to develop — a commit with no `(#N)` subject suffix
#      that no merged PR backs (`commits/{sha}/pulls == 0`). A direct push
#      bypasses review AND every required CI check (the highest-trust escape) yet
#      creates no PR + writes no snapshot, so triggers 1+2 are structurally blind
#      to it.
#   (overdue SMATCHET_DEVIATION is covered by the strict `deviation-overdue` lint.)
#
# Modes:
#   --list     (default) plain "postmortem owed: PR #N — <trigger>" lines.
#   --nudge    SessionStart-formatted block (silent when nothing is owed).
#   --blocking opt-in enforcement: same detection + `--list` output, but EXIT 1
#              when the owed-escape count exceeds POSTMORTEM_BLOCKING_GRACE
#              (default 0 → any owed escape fails). For a CI/pre-merge gate that
#              wants un-postmortemed escapes to actually stop the line, not just
#              nudge. Deliberately NOT wired into SessionStart (that stays
#              advisory) — a caller opts in explicitly. Degrades to advisory
#              exit 0 when gh is unavailable (no gate should hard-fail on a
#              missing/​unauthenticated gh, same fail-open as the other modes).
#
# Mirrors memory-drain-nudge.sh: deterministic check -> nudge, no investigation.
# Default modes (--list / --nudge) are advisory — never block, exit 0 always
# (even without gh; degrades to a notice). Only --blocking can exit non-zero,
# and only on a real owed-escape count over the grace.
#
# Test seams (production leaves all unset → identical behaviour):
#   POSTMORTEM_LEDGER             override the postmortems.md path (has_entry).
#   POSTMORTEM_CONFIG_FILE        override project.config.json (override labels +
#                                 required contexts).
#   POSTMORTEM_REQUIRED_CONTEXTS  override the branch-protection required-context
#                                 set (newline/comma separated). Set-but-EMPTY is
#                                 honoured (inert required-by-name scope) so a
#                                 fixture can opt in explicitly. Mirrors
#                                 merge-gates.sh MERGE_GATES_REQUIRED_CONTEXTS.
#   POSTMORTEM_OVERRIDE_LABELS    override the override-label set (space-separated)
#                                 without sourcing project-config.sh (python-free).
#   SNAPSHOT_LEDGER               override merge-snapshots.jsonl path.
#   POSTMORTEM_DIRECTPUSH_SINCE   git-log window for trigger 4 (default 7 days).
#   POSTMORTEM_DIRECTPUSH_MAX     cap on pulls-confirmation gh calls (default 40).
#   POSTMORTEM_ABSENT_GRACE_SECONDS
#                                 age a merge must reach before it is judged by the
#                                 required-ABSENT cross-check (default 3600). Covers
#                                 GitHub's check-suite creation lag; non-numeric →
#                                 default. Notification threshold only — see the

# REQUIRED-CONTEXT EFFECTIVE DATES. The required set read from branch protection
# is TODAY's, but the scan window is historical, so applying it uniformly would
# flag every PR that merged before a context was promoted — merges that were
# entirely correct. Since a promotion date is not persisted anywhere, each
# context is dated from the window itself: the earliest merge on which it was
# observed PRESENT. A PR that merged before that is not judged for it. A context
# observed on NO PR in the window cannot be dated at all — that is either a fresh
# promotion (benign) or a context that never reports (the #1941 escape), and the
# two are indistinguishable — so it is reported ONCE as a WARN rather than as one
# owed escape per PR, which is what would hard-fail `--blocking` at SessionStart.
# An EMPTY rollup is exempt from all of this and always flags: "no check of any
# kind ran" cannot be explained by a late promotion.

# Already has a postmortem? (a ledger ENTRY HEADING references "PR #<n>")
#
# Takes a PR NUMBER. Sha-keyed dedup (triggers 3+4) belongs to has_sha_entry.
#
# BOTH probes are heading-scoped, and that symmetry is the fix
# (postmortem-owed-prose-mention-false-dedup, tooling P1). Probe 2 always was;
# probe 1 was not, so it matched `PR #N` ANYWHERE in the file — and citing a PR
# in prose is how these entries are normally written ("shipped in PR #1953",
# "concurrently by PR #1078"). The effect was that any PR named in any entry's
# body was PERMANENTLY and SILENTLY exempted from ever being nudged again, in
# the one detector whose job is turning escapes into gates. Measured on the real
# ledger at the time: 12 PR numbers were deduped by prose alone, none of them
# with an entry of their own. #1962 was the reported instance — a genuine
# override escape reported as a clean window.
#
# Scoping is safe against the opposite error (re-nudging a PR that IS
# postmortemed): every PR-keyed heading in the ledger uses the documented
# `## <date> · PR #N[, #M …] · <trigger>` shape, so heading-scoping loses no
# real entry. The only heading carrying a bare `#N` without the `PR ` prefix is
# an Issue reference, which was never in scope here.
# The heading is `## <date> · PR #A[, #B][/#C] · <trigger>`, so `·` delimits the
# fields. Both probes are bounded to the FIRST TWO fields by `[^·]*(·[^·]*)?`,
# which keeps a `#N` in the TRIGGER text from deduping PR N: without it the old
# `.*` spanned the whole heading, so `## … · PR #1948 · … unwedge /#907` deduped
# #907. Same permanent silent suppression as the body-prose leak, one field in.
#
# The leading field is OPTIONAL, and that is load-bearing in both directions:
#   * `## RCA for PR #2006 — …` has no `·` at all and must still dedup (a
#     `·`-requiring anchor broke exactly this shape).
#   * `## 2026-06-07 · coverage.yml (since #834 graduation), fixed by PR #941 · …`
#     carries an unrelated `#834` BEFORE the PR reference, so "first `#` on the
#     line" is also wrong — it dropped this real entry and would have re-nudged
#     #941 forever.
# Verified on the live ledger by PER-PR-NUMBER sweep — every #N appearing in any
# `^## ` heading, asked "does has_entry dedup it?": 98/102 dedup; the 4 that keep
# nudging are all correct exclusions (`#834` = parenthetical annotation, `#863` =
# an Issue not a PR, `#1215`/`#1242` = trigger-prose references). The earlier
# heading-COUNT sweep (54 → 53) validated the two-field bound while missing that
# the escape·collateral shape lost #1571/#1572 — counting matched headings hides

# Each row: number <TAB> mergeCommit-oid <TAB> space-joined-labels <TAB>
# comma-joined-CURATED-red-checks. The mergeCommit column lets us key the lossless
# snapshot-ledger lookup (snapshot_trigger) on pr+mergeCommit before falling
# back to the (lossy) live labels/statusCheckRollup columns.
#
# CURATION (the red-checks column) follows merge-gates.sh's GATE_FILTER so the
# escape detector and the merge gate agree on what "red" means. The red-checks
# column alone is absence-BLIND — a required check that NEVER RAN produces no
# rollup row at all, so it is neither red nor pending, and a "merged with a
# required check absent" escape emits none of the four label/red/revert/deviation
# signals. That is now covered separately by the required-ABSENT cross-check
# below (field 5 vs $reqNames), mirroring merge-gates' pre-merge $reqAbsent block
# so the same escape is caught both before and after the merge.
#   (a) dedupe to the LATEST run per context (group_by name, max startedAt) — a
#       CANCELLED concurrency twin beside a later SUCCESS for the SAME context is
#       dropped (the dominant false positive: every perf/coverage workflow sets
#       cancel-in-progress; the `…/merge` ref run cancels the PR-head run).
#   (b) require a TERMINAL verdict — CheckRun COMPLETED with conclusion in
#       FAILURE/TIMED_OUT/CANCELLED/ACTION_REQUIRED/STARTUP_FAILURE, or
#       StatusContext state FAILURE/ERROR (same set merge-gates.sh blocks on).
#       CANCELLED counts only when it survives dedupe (a) — i.e. it is the
#       LATEST run for its context with no later SUCCESS — so a CANCELLED-latest
#       meant-to-block check that native-merged is an escape (#1566), while the
#       concurrency twin stays invisible; IN_PROGRESS/QUEUED/PENDING never count.
#   (c) require BLOCKING scope — the context is in branch_protection
#       .required_contexts ($reqNames) OR its name matches the meant-to-block
#       allow-list (ALLOW_LIST_RE) and is not "advisory". An advisory / non-
#       allow-list lane can never block a merge, so its red owes no postmortem.
# (postmortems.md 2026-06-09 PR #1046–#1072 over-report; #923 allow-list.)
#
# `gh pr list` has no mergedAt sort key, so over-fetch by its default
