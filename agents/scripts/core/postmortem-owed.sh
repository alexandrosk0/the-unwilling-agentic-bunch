# postmortem-owed.sh — detect gate escapes on recent `develop` merges and nudge
# for a blameless postmortem (see docs/plans/shipped/gate-escape-postmortem.md +
# the gate-escape-postmortem skill). A gate escape = something shipped that a
# gate should have caught; the "gate, don't trust" response is a NEW gate, filed
# via the postmortem's mandatory `### Preventing gate` field.
#
# Triggers (an escape lacking a postmortems.md entry referencing its PR):
#   1. non-SUCCESS check on the merged head (PRIMARY) — a BLOCKING-scope check
#      whose LATEST run was terminal non-SUCCESS (FAILURE, or CANCELLED with no
#      later run) yet merged. The most common escape. "Blocking scope" +
#      "latest-run terminal" follow merge-gates.sh's curation (see CURATION
#      below) so a CANCELLED concurrency twin beside a later SUCCESS / advisory
#      lane / in-progress check never reads as a red required check.
#   2. override label on the merged PR (project.config.json
#      merge_gates.override_labels) — but ONLY when the override was
#      LOAD-BEARING (its gated check did not pass on its own). A moot override
#      (gate green anyway) owes no postmortem.
#   3. a `Revert` commit on develop (a post-merge undo).
#   4. a PR-less direct push to develop — a commit with no `(#N)` subject suffix
#      that no merged PR backs (`commits/{sha}/pulls == 0`). A direct push
#      bypasses review AND every required CI check (the highest-trust escape) yet
#      creates no PR + writes no snapshot, so triggers 1+2 are structurally blind
#      to it.
#   (overdue SMATCHET_DEVIATION is covered by the strict `deviation-overdue` lint.)
#
# Modes:
#   --list     (default) plain "postmortem owed: PR #N — <trigger>" lines.
#   --nudge    SessionStart-formatted block (silent when nothing is owed).
#   --blocking opt-in enforcement: same detection + `--list` output, but EXIT 1
#              when the owed-escape count exceeds POSTMORTEM_BLOCKING_GRACE
#              (default 0 → any owed escape fails). For a CI/pre-merge gate that
#              wants un-postmortemed escapes to actually stop the line, not just
#              nudge. Deliberately NOT wired into SessionStart (that stays
#              advisory) — a caller opts in explicitly. Degrades to advisory
#              exit 0 when gh is unavailable (no gate should hard-fail on a
#              missing/​unauthenticated gh, same fail-open as the other modes).
#
# Mirrors memory-drain-nudge.sh: deterministic check -> nudge, no investigation.
# Default modes (--list / --nudge) are advisory — never block, exit 0 always
# (even without gh; degrades to a notice). Only --blocking can exit non-zero,
# and only on a real owed-escape count over the grace.
#
# Test seams (production leaves all unset → identical behaviour):
#   POSTMORTEM_LEDGER             override the postmortems.md path (has_entry).
#   POSTMORTEM_CONFIG_FILE        override project.config.json (override labels +
#                                 required contexts).
#   POSTMORTEM_REQUIRED_CONTEXTS  override the branch-protection required-context
#                                 set (newline/comma separated). Set-but-EMPTY is
#                                 honoured (inert required-by-name scope) so a
#                                 fixture can opt in explicitly. Mirrors
#                                 merge-gates.sh MERGE_GATES_REQUIRED_CONTEXTS.
#   POSTMORTEM_OVERRIDE_LABELS    override the override-label set (space-separated)
#                                 without sourcing project-config.sh (python-free).
#   SNAPSHOT_LEDGER               override merge-snapshots.jsonl path.
#   POSTMORTEM_DIRECTPUSH_SINCE   git-log window for trigger 4 (default 7 days).
#   POSTMORTEM_DIRECTPUSH_MAX     cap on pulls-confirmation gh calls (default 40).

# --- Trigger 1 + 2: per merged PR (checks + labels), ONE batched gh call ------
# `gh pr list --json statusCheckRollup` returns every PR's checks in a single
# API call — fast enough for a SessionStart hook (no per-PR `gh pr view` loop).
# Each row: number <TAB> mergeCommit-oid <TAB> space-joined-labels <TAB>
# comma-joined-CURATED-red-checks. The mergeCommit column lets us key the lossless
# snapshot-ledger lookup (snapshot_trigger) on pr+mergeCommit before falling
# back to the (lossy) live labels/statusCheckRollup columns.
#
# CURATION (the red-checks column) follows merge-gates.sh's GATE_FILTER so the
# escape detector and the merge gate agree on what "red" means. One deliberate
# divergence from merge-gates.sh, noted inline: there is NO required-context-ABSENT
# detector — a required check that NEVER RAN produces no rollup row, so a
# "merged with a required check absent" escape is invisible on this live path
# (merge-gates' $reqAbsent catches it pre-merge; here it would only surface via a
# recorded snapshot). That gap is pre-existing and left as a follow-up.
#   (a) dedupe to the LATEST run per context (group_by name, max startedAt) — a
#       CANCELLED concurrency twin beside a later SUCCESS for the SAME context is
#       dropped (the dominant false positive: every perf/coverage workflow sets
#       cancel-in-progress; the `…/merge` ref run cancels the PR-head run).
#   (b) require a TERMINAL verdict — CheckRun COMPLETED with conclusion in
#       FAILURE/TIMED_OUT/CANCELLED/ACTION_REQUIRED/STARTUP_FAILURE, or
#       StatusContext state FAILURE/ERROR (same set merge-gates.sh blocks on).
#       CANCELLED counts only when it survives dedupe (a) — i.e. it is the
#       LATEST run for its context with no later SUCCESS — so a CANCELLED-latest
#       meant-to-block check that native-merged is an escape (#1566), while the
#       concurrency twin stays invisible; IN_PROGRESS/QUEUED/PENDING never count.
#   (c) require BLOCKING scope — the context is in branch_protection
#       .required_contexts ($reqNames) OR its name matches the meant-to-block
#       allow-list (ALLOW_LIST_RE) and is not "advisory". An advisory / non-
#       allow-list lane can never block a merge, so its red owes no postmortem.
# (postmortems.md 2026-06-09 PR #1046–#1072 over-report; #923 allow-list.)
#
# `gh pr list` has no mergedAt sort key, so over-fetch by its default
# createdAt-desc order, then re-sort by mergedAt and keep the most-recently
# MERGED SCAN_N. Without this, a long-lived branch created early but merged
# late falls outside a createdAt-ordered window and its escape is never seen.
