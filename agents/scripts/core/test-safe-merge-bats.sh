# test-safe-merge-bats.sh — bats wrapper for tests/bats/safe_merge.bats.
#
# Bucket A (CLI) per AGENTS.md § Verification automation. Zero manual steps.
# Auto-enrolled by scripts/dev/test-all.sh via the test-*.sh glob. Lives under
# agents/scripts/core/ so the Phase B seed (--path agents/) carries this wrapper
# with tests/bats/safe_merge.bats (plan A1w / row 8e). Required by the
# orphan-bats gate (agents/scripts/core/test-orphan-bats.sh): a .bats with no
# wrapper naming it never runs. See that bats file's header for the system under
# test (safe-merge.sh, the non-admin merge wrapper).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — every bats test passed
#   1 — at least one bats test failed
#   2 — bats binary missing (BUILD.md § Dev-script CLI tools)
