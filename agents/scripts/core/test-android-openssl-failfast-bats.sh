# test-android-openssl-failfast-bats.sh — bats wrapper for
# tests/bats/android_openssl_failfast.bats.
#
# Bucket A (CLI) per AGENTS.md § Verification automation. Zero manual steps.
# Auto-enrolled by scripts/dev/test-all.sh via the test-*.sh glob. Lives under
# agents/scripts/core/ so the Phase B seed (--path agents/) carries this wrapper
# with tests/bats/android_openssl_failfast.bats (plan A1w / row 8e). BEHAVIORAL
# companion to the static text gate agents/scripts/project/test-mobile-security.sh:
# it drives the REAL Issue #1068 fail-fast (cmake/SmatchetThirdParty.cmake's
# smatchet_prepare_cpr) in `cmake -P` script mode against committed fixture trees,
# proving the EXISTS-triple guard LOGIC actually fails the configure — not just
# that the marker text is present.
#
# Plan: docs/plans/mobile-mvp-completion.md (WS5 item 19).
#
# Exit codes (test-author convention):
#   0 — every bats test passed
#   1 — at least one bats test failed
#   2 — bats binary missing (BUILD.md § Dev-script CLI tools)
