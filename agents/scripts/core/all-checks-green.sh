# all-checks-green.sh — decision logic of the `All checks green (block-on-any-red)`
# aggregate check (.github/workflows/all-checks-green.yml).
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY (postmortems.md 2026-10-04 PR #2286; backlog infra/2026-10-04-native-auto-
# merge-merges-past-a-red-non-required-check): GitHub's native auto-merge waits
# only on the branch-protection REQUIRED contexts. Block-on-any-red lives in the
# merge-gates poller, which only runs when the merge goes through safe-merge.sh /
# git-janitor / the merge-watcher — so every other arm path (a harness auto-merge
# tool, a GitHub-MCP tool, the web UI, bare `gh pr merge --auto`) merged past a
# red or still-pending NON-required check. This script turns block-on-any-red into
# ONE check GitHub itself can require: it polls the PR head's check runs + commit
# statuses until every OTHER check is terminal, fails fast on the first blocking
# red, and passes only when everything is terminal and green.
#
# RULES — the CI half of merge-gates.d/10-gate-filter.sh, ported to the REST
# checks API (the GraphQL GATE_FILTER also scores CodeRabbit / Bugbot / comments /
# review state, which are not checks, so it cannot be reused verbatim):
#   * latest run per name — newest check suite (suite id, monotonic in creation
#     order: the REST stand-in for the filter's checkSuite.createdAt), then the
#     newest run in it (run id, also creation order — unlike started_at it is set
#     on a still-queued re-run); a re-run supersedes, a cancelled concurrency
#     twin in an older suite does not count. Runs are fetched with filter=all so
#     a queued / in-progress re-run attempt is never hidden behind the completed
#     attempt it replaces;
#   * red = a completed run concluding failure / timed_out / cancelled /
#     action_required / startup_failure, or a status in failure / error;
#     pending = a run not yet completed, or a status in pending / expected;
#   * advisory-name exemption — a check whose NAME contains "advisory" (any case)
#     never blocks, unless it is itself a required context;
#   * self-exclusion — every run / status named exactly like this check;
#   * required-absent — a branch_protection.required_contexts name with no run or
#     status on the head yet counts as pending (it has not reported);
#   * the poller's out-of-band downgrades: tests-out-of-band (Test-delta gate),
#     perf-out-of-band (Perf PR-fast*), intent-out-of-band (Intent section),
#     plan-lock-out-of-band PAIRED with a plan-lock-disposition (label
#     `plan-lock-disposition:<why>` or a PR-body marker line) for the Plan-lock
#     gate, and cr-out-of-band PAIRED with a cr-disposition (same two forms) for
#     the CR finding check + `CR findings*` status — red OR pending. Both trails
#     are read by the poller's OWN jq def, _MG_JQ_DISPOSITION_DEF, sourced from
#     merge-gates.d/10-gate-filter.sh (marker at line start, outside an HTML
#     comment, no `<...>` placeholder reason; labels follow the reason rule), so
#     the aggregate is never laxer than the poller it stands in for. The poller's
#     stale-override freshness conjunct is NOT ported: the two label-reactive
#     checks it guards are themselves required contexts, so GitHub still waits on
#     their post-label re-run directly, and the settle re-poll below sees a re-run
#     that lands after the label.
#
# LIVE MODE (default — the workflow): env ACG_REPO (owner/name), ACG_PR, ACG_SHA
# (the PR head the run is attached to); GH_TOKEN for `gh api`. Polls every
# ACG_POLL_SECONDS (default 90, floor 30). REST BUDGET — each poll reads 2-3
# lists from the 1,000/h per-repo GITHUB_TOKEN budget every workflow shares, so:
#   * every GET is conditional (If-None-Match with the ETag of the last 200 for
#     that page); an unchanged list answers 304, which GitHub does not count
#     against the rate limit, and the cached body is reused;
#   * X-RateLimit-Remaining is read off every response: below ACG_RL_LOW
#     (default 200) the poll interval widens x4; below ACG_RL_STOP (default 50),
#     or on a rate-limited 403/429, polling pauses until X-RateLimit-Reset (the
#     check stays pending meanwhile; the wait budget still bounds it).
# Failure modes:
#   * first blocking red -> exit 1 at once (fail fast);
#   * all terminal + green -> re-poll after ACG_SETTLE_SECONDS (default 60) and
#     pass only if the check set is unchanged (late checks: a dependent job, the
#     code-scanning result check, a label-triggered re-run);
#   * PR head moved -> exit 1 (this run's verdict is void; the new head gets
#     its own run);
#   * PR no longer open (merged / closed) -> exit 0 with a "verdict moot"
#     notice: a red here would leave a FAILURE check on nearly every merged
#     head (a merge through safe-merge.sh does not wait for this check), which
#     reads as a gate escape to anything auditing merged heads;
#   * still pending at ACG_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS (default 10200 = 170 min) -> exit 1
#     (a timeout is red, fail-closed; re-running the job or any label change
#     clears it). The budget must outlast the slowest LEGITIMATE path, not the
#     typical one: CodeQL analyze alone may run its 90-min timeout-minutes, and
#     Windows + MSVC (45) feeds Bucket-E (45) serially, each after queueing for
#     a runner — 170 min covers either with queue slack. The workflow's
#     timeout-minutes sits above budget + the longest post-deadline sleep, so
#     the script, not the runner, reports the pending set (bats pins it);
#   * ACG_MAX_API_FAILURES (default 10) consecutive API failures -> exit 2.
# The PR (head, state, labels, body) is re-read every ACG_PR_REFRESH_POLLS
# (default 5) polls and always before a terminal verdict.
#
# FIXTURE MODE: --fixture <json> evaluates one snapshot and exits — bats replays
# the #2286 check list through it. The JSON carries `check_runs` / `statuses`
# (REST shapes), optional `labels`, `body`, `required_contexts`, `self`.
#
# Env (both modes): ACG_SELF (this check's name), ACG_REQUIRED_CONTEXTS
# (NEWLINE-separated — check names can contain commas; overrides the fixture's /
# project.config.json's set — set but empty disables the required-absent rule).
# Test seams: ACG_SLEEP_BIN (default `sleep`), ACG_PER_PAGE (default 100).
#
# Exit: 0 success / verdict moot (PR no longer open) · 1 failure (red, timeout,
#       superseded) · 2 usage / API error · 3 pending (fixture mode only).
# Tests: tests/bats/all_checks_green.bats.
