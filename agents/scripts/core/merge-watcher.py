"""
merge-watcher — foreground daemon that polls every registered PR.

Phase 1 of `docs/plans/shipped/smatchet-merge-watcher.md`. Reads the per-user
registry at `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Smatchet/merge-watch/active.json` (managed
by `merge-watcher-cli.py`), runs `agents/scripts/core/merge-gates.sh` for each
entry per the configured interval, writes per-PR state to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%/Smatchet/merge-watch/state/<pr>.json`, emits structured
stdout per poll cycle.

Scope has grown past the original poll-only Phase 1: the daemon now acts
on the parsed `merge-gates.sh` state. A GATES_PASSED PR drives squash
auto-merge + cascade to stacked children (Phase 2 — `handle_pass` →
`squash_merge_pr`), BLOCKED on CodeRabbit findings drives the triage
classifier (Phase 3 — `invoke_triage`), and terminal states fire
human-facing notification (Phase 4a — `smatchet-notify.sh`). The
auto-merge path is live, not observe-only: once gates pass the daemon
squash-merges without further prompting. Env knobs below tune the
surrounding behaviour (sanitizer auto-act, CR grace cycles), not whether
a clean PASS merges.

Usage:
  merge-watcher daemon                # foreground (default)
  merge-watcher daemon --background   # detached (Phase 1 stub; for now defers to user using `&`)

Env knobs:
  MERGE_WATCH_POLL_INTERVAL         — seconds between per-PR polls (default 60).
  MERGE_GATES_*                     — inherited by merge-gates.sh per its own contract.
  ORCH_USER                         — required by merge-gates.sh.
  MERGE_WATCH_AUTO_ACT_ON_SANITIZER — opt-in (default false). When true, sanitizer
                                      CI failures trigger auto-act with debug-detective
                                      (skips coderabbit-triage).
  MERGE_WATCH_CR_NONE_GRACE_CYCLES  — poll cycles to wait before treating a NONE +
                                      status-SUCCESS / NONE + pending CodeRabbit state
                                      (skipped or absent review) as pass (default 10;
                                      floored at 1). Mirrors merge-gates.sh CR_GRACE_POLLS
                                      but measured across real cycles, since the daemon
                                      drives merge-gates with MAX_POLLS=1 (its in-process
                                      grace window can never elapse). See
                                      `maybe_pass_cr_none_grace`.
  MERGE_WATCH_CR_NONE_GRACE_CYCLES_PURE_DOCS
                                    — same window, but used when the PR's diff is
                                      pure-docs (per is-pure-docs-diff.sh's allow-list:
                                      docs/, backlog/, agents/scripts/, any *.md).
                                      Default 1 (floored at 1). On a pure-docs diff
                                      CodeRabbit's "Review skipped" is its TERMINAL
                                      verdict — no inline review will ever land — so
                                      the full code-diff grace (10 cycles ≈ 10 min) is
                                      pure dead wait. Shrinking it to ~1 cycle lets a
                                      backlog/docs PR merge in ~1 poll once its required
                                      checks (incl. the `CR finding gate` status check,
                                      which still gates the squash) are green. Does NOT
                                      bypass CR or branch protection — only collapses a
                                      wait that exists for code diffs. See
                                      `maybe_pass_cr_none_grace`.
  MERGE_WATCH_AUTO_RESYNC           — gate-logic self-resync (default "on"; #1428
                                      residual). At startup + every
                                      MERGE_WATCH_RESYNC_EVERY_CYCLES cycles the daemon
                                      checks whether its long-lived host checkout has
                                      drifted behind origin/develop on any gate-logic file
                                      (merge-gates.sh / its .graphql / merge-watcher*.py);
                                      on a SAFE fast-forward (clean tree, on develop, no
                                      divergence) it pulls develop so the on-disk gate
                                      scripts go fresh again — the throughput-safe
                                      complement to merge-gates.sh's FAIL-CLOSED
                                      MERGE_GATES_FRESHNESS guard (which preserves
                                      correctness but wedges a stale daemon at zero merge
                                      throughput). When the daemon's OWN code drifted it
                                      re-execs (POSIX) to load it. "off" disables the
                                      resync, leaving only the fail-closed guard. The
                                      unsafe-tree case (the #1428 feature-branch park) is
                                      never auto-mutated — it warns + waits for a human.
                                      See `maybe_self_resync`.
  MERGE_WATCH_RESYNC_EVERY_CYCLES   — poll cycles between periodic self-resync checks
                                      (default 30; floored at 1). A startup check always
                                      runs regardless of this cadence.

# The watcher runs as a LONG-LIVED daemon from its own host checkout. merge-gates.sh
# (the actual merge-eligibility logic) is re-read from disk as a fresh subprocess on
# every poll, so a checkout parked behind origin/develop silently enforces STALE gate
# rules — the #1428 escape (an old block-allow-list merged a PR past a RED "Intent
# section"). The shipped fix is a FAIL-CLOSED freshness guard inside merge-gates.sh
# (MERGE_GATES_FRESHNESS=block): it refuses GATES_PASSED when its on-disk blob differs
# from origin/develop's. That preserves correctness but WEDGES throughput — a stale
# daemon merges nothing until a human refreshes the checkout. This self-resync is the
# throughput-safe complement: detect the drift, fast-forward-pull develop so the on-disk
# gate scripts go fresh again (which un-wedges the freshness guard), and — only when the
# daemon's OWN code drifted — re-exec to load it. SAFE-ONLY: it never pulls over a dirty
# tree or switches a branch (the banned shared-tree rug-pull, AGENTS.md § Concurrent
# sessions); the #1428 "parked on a feature branch" tree is left to a human with a loud

    Triggers only when the status line indicates a CR-finding block (matches

    (CI fail, user comment, missing review) don't fire triage.

    triage retries don't fix code, they only re-classify. The loop's value

    poll index `p >= CR_GRACE_POLLS`, but `poll_one` runs merge-gates with
    MERGE_GATES_MAX_POLLS=1, so `p` is always 0 — the grace window can never
    elapse within a single invocation and resets every cycle.

    Fix: count consecutive grace-wait cycles per HEAD in the registry; once the

    ONCE with MERGE_GATES_CR_GRACE_POLLS=0 so the single poll's grace
    comparison passes and the gate returns GATES_PASSED (which the daemon
    routes into handle_pass). Preserves the grace INTENT (wall-clock wait
    before assuming a status-only / skipped review) while making it reachable.

    Returns a state-delta dict (merged into `state` by the daemon). When the

    """Option-A loop closer — spawn `claude -p ...` in the background to
    address CR findings OR sanitizer failures when the watcher detects them.

    CR-finding path: Opt-in via `MERGE_WATCH_AUTO_ACT=true`.
    Sanitizer path:  Opt-in via `MERGE_WATCH_AUTO_ACT_ON_SANITIZER=true`
                     (separate knob — sanitizer auto-act is independent).

    Off by default — auto-spawning a Claude session against a checked-in
    clone has real cost (token spend) + runaway-loop risk. Safeguards:

      - Single attempt per (PR, head_sha) pair. Dedup key persisted on the
        registry entry's `auto_act_for_head_sha` field. A push to the PR
        (which advances head_sha) unlocks one more attempt — bounded by:
      - Per-PR-lifetime budget. `MERGE_WATCH_AUTO_ACT_BUDGET` (default 2).
        Once attempts >= budget the auto-act stops firing on this PR even
        on new pushes; the user `merge-watch unregister`s to take back.
      - Refuses if `claude` is not on PATH (no silent no-op).
      - Refuses if the clone has uncommitted tracked-modified files (a
        concurrent agent / user may be editing).
      - Detached subprocess so the daemon's poll loop is NOT blocked by
        Claude's session runtime; output captured to a per-(PR,sha) log
        file under the state dir for after-the-fact inspection.

    When the trigger is a sanitizer failure (not CR-finding), the spawned
    session invokes `debug-detective` directly — skips `coderabbit-triage`.
