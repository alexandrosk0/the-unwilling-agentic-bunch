# test-merge-gates.sh — bats wrapper for tests/bats/merge_gates.bats.
#
# Bucket A (CLI) per AGENTS.md § Verification automation. Zero manual steps.
# Auto-enrolled by scripts/dev/test-all.sh via the test-*.sh glob.
#
# Wraps the bats regression suite for agents/scripts/core/merge-gates.sh + emits the
# canonical `Passed: N  Failed: M` line that test-all.sh greps for.
#
# Exit codes follow the test-author convention:
#   0 — every bats test passed
#   1 — at least one bats test failed
#   2 — bats binary missing (BUILD.md § Dev-script CLI tools lists the install)
