# test-lock-cleanup-bats.sh — bats wrapper for tests/bats/lock_cleanup.bats.
#
# Bucket A (CLI) per AGENTS.md § Verification automation. Zero manual steps.
# Auto-enrolled by scripts/dev/test-all.sh via the test-*.sh glob.
#
# Pins the .github/workflows/lock-cleanup.yml lock-slug parse regex (the
# seed↔cleanup contract, plan-lock-enforcement items 8 + 11) and the
# closed-unmerged release relaxation. Emits the canonical `Passed: N Failed: M`
# line test-all.sh greps.
#
# Exit codes follow the test-author convention:
#   0 — every bats test passed
#   1 — at least one bats test failed
#   2 — bats binary missing (BUILD.md § Dev-script CLI tools lists the install)
