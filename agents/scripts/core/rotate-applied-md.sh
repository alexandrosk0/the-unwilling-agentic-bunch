# agents/scripts/core/rotate-applied-md.sh — bound applied.md by rotating old
# months into flat sibling partitions.
#
# applied.md is a monotonically growing append-target (archive-backlog-entry.sh
# prepends; sort-applied-md.sh keeps "Latest first"). Unbounded, it passed 1 MB
# within ~3.5 months. This script moves every entry OLDER than the current and
# previous calendar month into `applied-YYYY-MM.md` next to applied.md — flat
# siblings, NOT a subdirectory, deliberately: archive-backlog-entry.sh rewrites
# each archived entry's relative links to applied.md's exact depth
# (`categories/`), so a deeper partition dir would break every link in a
# rotated entry. Same-depth siblings keep them valid with zero rewriting.
#
# Partition files are created with a standard header (including the
# deleted-runtime banner, which is self-scoping: it annotates only entries
# that reference the removed agentic-flow C++ runtime) and are sorted latest
# first, like the head. Rotation appends to an existing partition and re-sorts
# it. Idempotent: a second run is a no-op.
#
# Invoked automatically by archive-backlog-entry.sh after each append, so the
# head stays bounded by construction. test-backlog-counts.sh runs `--check`
# as an ADVISORY (WARN-only) freshness signal — a month boundary can make
# rotation "due" with no accompanying change, so a hard gate would spontaneously
# red CI; the next archival rotates for real.
#
# Usage:
#   bash agents/scripts/core/rotate-applied-md.sh            # rotate in place
#   bash agents/scripts/core/rotate-applied-md.sh --check    # exit 1 if rotation is due
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — rotated (or nothing to rotate; or --check with nothing due)
#   1 — --check mode and rotation is due; OR Python error via `set -e`
#   2 — applied.md not found / no python
