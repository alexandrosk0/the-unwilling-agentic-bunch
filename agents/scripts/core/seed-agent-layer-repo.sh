# cannot be un-published — so phase 5 hard-refuses unless phase 4b is clean.

#   a) gh repo create alexandrosk0/the-unwilling-agentic-bunch --public

seed-agent-layer-repo.sh — seed the public agent-layer repo from a Smatchet clone.

  seed-agent-layer-repo.sh --target <owner/repo> [--work-dir DIR] [--dry-run] [--help]
  seed-agent-layer-repo.sh --simulate [--target <owner/repo>]
  seed-agent-layer-repo.sh --print-bats-block

Options (both --key value and --key=value forms are accepted):
  --target <owner/repo>   Destination repo, e.g. alexandrosk0/the-unwilling-agentic-bunch.
                          Required. Must already exist and have ZERO commits.
  --work-dir DIR          Scratch dir for the fresh clone + rewrite. Must NOT exist:
                          git-filter-repo refuses any repo that is not a fresh clone,
                          and the fix is always a new directory, never --force (which
                          also suppresses filter-repo's own not-empty-target check).
                          Default: $TMPDIR/agent-layer-seed.$$
  --dry-run               Run phases 1-2 and stop after printing the manifest.
                          Preflight probes report PASS/WARN instead of exiting, so a
                          dry run is useful BEFORE the human preconditions are met —
                          which is the window it exists for. A real run keeps the
                          strict exit-2 / exit-3 semantics.
  --simulate              Phases 1-2 as --dry-run, then build an image of the
                          validated commit (manifest + scaffold) and run the layer's
                          three CI lanes in it via agent-layer-sim.sh (~25 min).
                          Proves the manifest is COMPLETE, which phase 2 cannot.
                          Manifest paths must be committed (a dirty tree is a hard
                          stop, unlike --dry-run). --target is optional here.
  --print-bats-block      Print the generated tests/bats block of seed-paths.txt
                          (the suites layer-side wrappers run) and exit.
  --help                  This text.

Exit: 0 seeded (or dry-run review passed) | 1 assertion failed
      2 usage / tooling missing           | 3 target not empty

Phases:
  1 preflight   tooling on PATH, gh auth, secret scanner, target exists and is
                empty, work-dir absent
  2 manifest    pin the validated commit (manifest paths must be clean); regenerate
                seed-paths.txt; assert the bats-count tripwire, the 8e
                suite/wrapper co-location invariant, and that no forbidden path
                slipped in; print the manifest.  --dry-run STOPS HERE.
  3 rewrite     fresh clone (--no-local --no-tags --single-branch --branch develop),
                refused unless it resolves to the commit phase 2 validated; then
                git filter-repo --paths-from-file, then the paired
                --invert-paths scrub pass if seed-scrub-paths.txt is non-empty
  4 scaffold    copy the scaffold image (row 9 CI files, row 10 root files,
                .coderabbit.yaml, .gitignore, docs/seed-paths.txt,
                docs/seed-audit.md, ...); commit
  4b audit      history-wide secret scan of the REWRITTEN history, plus assert the
                rewritten `git ls-files` is a SUBSET of the manifest and that every
                manifest path has exactly one CLEAR (or enforced SCRUB) verdict in
                docs/seed-audit.md. Any hit is a hard stop; nothing is pushed until
                this is clean.
  4c lanes      run the layer's own CI lanes on the rewritten clone
                (agent-layer-sim.sh --run-only); red, or any file the lanes
                change or create outside .gitignore, is a hard stop.
  5 publish     hard-refuses unless 4b and 4c cleared; remote add plus push develop;
                gh label create; setup-branch-protection.sh (failure = failed seed)
  6 report      the row-8 Accept checks with PASS/FAIL and the seed SHA

Human preconditions (pause exception 3 — this script does none of them):
  gh repo create <target> --public   with NO auto-init
  pip install git-filter-repo        (git >= 2.24, python >= 3.6)
  CodeRabbit app installed on the new repo
