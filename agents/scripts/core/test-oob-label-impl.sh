#
# Class of bug this kills (preventing gate from postmortems.md 2026-06-07
# coverage prose-promise): an escape-hatch label is documented in a workflow
# comment / AGENTS.md § Merge gates at gate-graduation time but never wired into
# any code that reads it — so the "escape" silently does nothing until the first
# PR that needs it (discovered only mid-flight, e.g. coverage-out-of-band on
# #939). A label that is only ever mentioned in prose/comments, never read by a
# non-comment line of a workflow or merge-gates.sh, FAILS this gate.
#
# Definitions:
#   DOCUMENTED  — a `<prefix>-out-of-band` token appears anywhere (comment, prose,
#                 or code) in the discovery corpus: .github/workflows/*.yml,
#                 AGENTS.md, docs/agent-rules/merge-gates.md.
#   IMPLEMENTED — the same token appears on at least one NON-comment line (first
#                 non-space char is not '#') of an impl file: .github/workflows/*.yml
#                 or agents/scripts/core/merge-gates.sh. That is a step/branch that
#                 actually reads the label.
#
# PARITY (2026-07-08, deps-override-label-parity-test): the no-arg run ALSO
# asserts the CI-downgrade label set wired in merge-gates.sh poll_merge_gates
# ($downgraded) equals the set wired in safe-admin-merge.sh evaluate_rollup —
# the two merge paths a `*-out-of-band` label must reach. ADR-0022's
# intent-out-of-band shipped honoring only the poller (surfaced live on #1435);
# plan-lock-out-of-band repeated the class until 2026-07-08. Both sets are
# extracted mechanically (label→jq-var bindings resolved against each script's
# downgrade expression), so a half-wired addition FAILS here.
#
# Override root (testing): SMATCHET_OOB_ROOT points the corpus at a fixture tree.
# SMATCHET_OOB_MG_FILE / SMATCHET_OOB_SAM_FILE point the parity extraction at
# fixture scripts (default: the real merge-gates.sh / safe-admin-merge.sh).
#
# Usage:
#   bash agents/scripts/core/test-oob-label-impl.sh            # scan the real tree
#   bash agents/scripts/core/test-oob-label-impl.sh --selftest # fixture dogfood
#
# Exit: 0 every documented label is implemented (and the two merge paths agree) ·
#       1 a documented-but-unimplemented label / a poller-vs-admin divergence
#       (or --selftest failure) · 2 infra error.
# Goes through test-shell-lint.sh + the test-gate-selftests.sh marker check.
