# test-required-context-parity.sh — assert every branch-protection REQUIRED
# context emits UNCONDITIONALLY (no paths-filtered deadlock).
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS (infra.md 2026-06-05 P1 · postmortems.md "required-but-path-
# filtered check")
#   `Doc anchors + agent contract` was a REQUIRED branch-protection context
#   (project.config.json § branch_protection.required_contexts) whose emitting
#   workflow doc-validation.yml was `paths:`-filtered. A PR touching none of the
#   filtered paths never produced the context, so GitHub held it BLOCKED forever
#   — deadlocking #880/#881/#882 (pure product/test diffs). PR #884 fixed the one
#   workflow (runs on every PR + self-gates), but NOTHING prevents the NEXT
#   required context added with a `paths:` filter from recreating the deadlock.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE ASSERTS
#   For each `branch_protection.required_contexts` entry in project.config.json:
#     1. Resolve it to its emitting workflow+job via the shared resolution map
#        (lib/ci-check-resolve.sh). FAIL CLOSED if unresolvable — an
#        unresolvable required context IS the deadlock risk (it can never report
#        on a PR whose paths the orphaned/renamed workflow no longer matches).
#     2. Assert the emitting workflow's `on.pull_request` has NO `paths:` /
#        `paths-ignore:` filter — UNLESS that workflow carries the documented
#        self-gate marker `# ci-required-context: self-gated` (the #884 shape:
#        the workflow runs unconditionally but the job internally short-circuits,
#        so the required context is ALWAYS reported exactly once).
#
# WHY FAIL-CLOSED ON UNRESOLVABLE
#   The whole bug class is "a required check that silently never reports." A
#   parity gate that SKIPPED names it can't resolve would reintroduce the exact
#   blind spot. Unresolvable => FAIL, forcing the author to fix the name or
#   document the self-gate.
#
# MODES
#   (no args) | --check   resolve every live required_contexts entry against the
#                         live .github/workflows; FAIL (1) on any path-filtered
#                         or unresolvable required context. This is what
#                         scripts/dev/test-all.sh runs (no-arg).
#   --selftest            self-contained proof against synthetic fixtures: a
#                         clean context PASSES, a path-filtered context FAILS, an
#                         unresolvable context FAILS, a self-gate-marked
#                         path-filtered context PASSES. Asserts failure cases.
#
# EXIT  0 every required context emits unconditionally (or self-gated) ·
#       1 a path-filtered / unresolvable required context · 2 infra error.
#
# Goes through test-shell-lint.sh (5 rules) + the shellcheck warning fail-set.
# selftest: asserts-failure — the --selftest path feeds a path-filtered + an
# unresolvable fixture and asserts the gate FAILS on each (its core duty).
