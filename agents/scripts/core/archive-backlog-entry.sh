# archive-backlog-entry.sh — archive a per-entry self-improvement backlog file
# into the union-merged `applied.md`, fixing BOTH directions of link breakage
# that the raw `cat >> … && git rm` recipe causes.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (per-entry-archival-breaks-relative-links, tooling P2)
#   The documented recipe was:
#       cat docs/self-improvement/categories/<cat>/<file>.md >> …/applied.md
#       git rm docs/self-improvement/categories/<cat>/<file>.md
#   Per-entry files live at `categories/<cat>/`; `applied.md` lives one level up
#   at `categories/`. So the recipe breaks links twice over:
#
#   OUTBOUND — every relative link in the body is off by one directory the
#   instant it is appended. `cat` cannot fail here, so it fails SILENTLY; the
#   only signal is the docs gate reporting on applied.md later. Live cost when
#   archiving `2026-08-06-gate-tooling-run-from-stale-session-branch`: 7 dangling
#   links in one entry.
#
#   INBOUND — and this is the worse half — the `git rm` deletes a path other
#   documents cite. Those referrers are unmodified, so a diff-scoped check cannot
#   see the breakage; only a repo-wide `--all` sweep does. The same archival left
#   2 inbound dangling links (from postmortems.md and a sibling entry) and
#   surfaced as a RED REQUIRED CHECK rather than a local failure.
#
#   A script is the right shape rather than a documented sed: the outbound
#   transform depends on the source entry's depth, which is exactly the detail a
#   human copying a command out of a doc will not re-derive.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   1. Rewrites the body's relative links for their new home (see re-depth note
#      below) — link targets only, never prose.
#   2. Finds inbound references to the entry across the repo and repoints markdown
#      links at `applied.md`, at each referrer's own correct depth. REFUSES to
#      delete while any inbound markdown link remains unresolved.
#   3. Appends the rewritten body to applied.md, `git rm`s the source, stages both.
#   4. Re-runs `test-markdown-links.sh --all` as a self-check — `--all` is
#      load-bearing: the default diff scope sees neither the re-parented body nor
#      the orphaned referrers.
#
# Usage:
#   bash agents/scripts/core/archive-backlog-entry.sh <path-to-entry.md>
#   bash agents/scripts/core/archive-backlog-entry.sh --dry-run <path>   # print, touch nothing
#   bash agents/scripts/core/archive-backlog-entry.sh --selftest
#
# Env: ARCHIVE_SKIP_LINK_CHECK=1  skip step 4 (bats uses this — the self-check
#      scans the real repo, which a fixture archival must not depend on).
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok · 2 bad args / missing file · 3 unresolved inbound reference
#             · 4 post-archive link check failed.

# to `categories/<cat>/` resolves to `categories/<cat>/X`; from applied.md's home
# at `categories/` the equivalent link is normalize("<cat>/" + X). That single
# rule subsumes every case the backlog entry enumerated by hand —
# `../../../../agents/…` → `../../../agents/…`, `../tooling/slug.md` →
# `tooling/slug.md`, `../applied.md` → `applied.md` — and, unlike a sed table,
# it stays correct if the per-entry convention ever nests deeper.
