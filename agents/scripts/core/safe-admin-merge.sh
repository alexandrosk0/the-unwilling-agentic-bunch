# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Safe admin-merge guard — the orchestrator MUST call this instead of a bare
# `gh pr merge <pr> --squash --admin`.
#
# The preventing gate for the 2026-06-13 #1180 escape (postmortems.md): the
# orchestrator admin-merged #1180 while Bucket-C/E (on the merge-gates
# `Bucket-*` block allow-list) were RED, because the pre-merge "0 failures"
# re-confirm was an informational `echo` and `gh pr merge --admin` ran as a
# separate unconditional statement — the printed "FAIL" could not stop the
# merge, and `--admin` bypassed branch protection. The legitimate carve-out
# (admin-merge a STALE-BLOCKED PR only when everything is actually green) was
# asserted in prose, not enforced by an exit code.
#
# (Historical note: `Bucket-*` was DROPPED from $MERGE_GATES_BLOCK_ALLOWLIST_RE
# on 2026-06-15 — the Mesa-software-GL bucket-C/E lanes cannot boot the CI exe
# (infra.md `bucket-mesa-exe-boot` P1), so a RED bucket lane no longer gates
# this guard. The #1180 escape above predates that flip; re-add when the lane
# graduates back to hard-fail.)
#
# This guard makes the green assertion an EXIT CODE, not text:
#   * reads the head's statusCheckRollup (`gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup`)
#   * EXITS NON-ZERO without merging if ANY required-or-allow-listed check is
#     non-green (failing OR still pending) — only a genuinely stale-BLOCKED PR
#     whose every gating check is green is allowed through, and only THEN does
#     it run `gh pr merge --squash --admin`.
#
# Single-source-of-truth: the meant-to-block allow-list regex is NOT duplicated
# here — it is SOURCED from merge-gates.sh ($MERGE_GATES_BLOCK_ALLOWLIST_RE).
# Change the allow-list there and this guard follows automatically.
#
# A check BLOCKS the admin-merge when BOTH:
#   (1) it is gating — REQUIRED (name ∈ branch_protection.required_contexts) OR
#       allow-listed (name matches $MERGE_GATES_BLOCK_ALLOWLIST_RE, non-advisory)
#   (2) it is non-green — a CheckRun that is not COMPLETED, or whose conclusion
#       is not in {SUCCESS, NEUTRAL, SKIPPED}; or a StatusContext whose state is
#       not SUCCESS. (Pending counts as non-green: a stale-BLOCKED-green PR has
#       no pending gating checks left.)
# A non-gating red (e.g. an advisory check, or a non-required non-allow-listed
# one) does NOT block — mirroring the merge-gates $failing contract exactly.
#
# `*-out-of-band` PR labels downgrade the matching check, same as the poller:
#   tests-out-of-band → "Test-delta gate"   ·  perf-out-of-band → "Perf PR-fast*"
# (cr-out-of-band is a CodeRabbit-only override and does not apply to a CI check.)
#
# Usage:
#   agents/scripts/core/safe-admin-merge.sh <pr>
#   agents/scripts/core/safe-admin-merge.sh --selftest
#
# Env knobs:
#   SAFE_ADMIN_MERGE_DRY_RUN     — when "true", print the merge command instead
#                                  of executing it (the gate still runs).
#   SAFE_ADMIN_MERGE_REQUIRED_CONTEXTS — override the required-context set
#                                  (newline/comma-separated). When set (even ""),
#                                  bypasses the project.config.json read. Tests
#                                  inject a fixture-matching set this way.
#   SAFE_ADMIN_MERGE_CONFIG_FILE — override project.config.json path.
#   SAFE_ADMIN_MERGE_STUB_ROLLUP — TEST-ONLY: a JSON blob used in place of the
#                                  `gh pr view` call (the full --json object:
#                                  {statusCheckRollup,state,labels}). Lets
#                                  --selftest + bats feed a synthetic rollup with
#                                  zero `gh` involvement.
#
# Return codes:
#   0 — guard passed; admin-merge performed (or dry-run printed)
#   1 — REFUSED: a gating check is non-green (no merge performed)
#   2 — usage / dependency error (gh or jq missing, bad args)
#   3 — PR not in a mergeable precondition (not OPEN)
