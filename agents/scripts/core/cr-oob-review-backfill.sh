# cr-oob-review-backfill.sh — drip a retroactive CodeRabbit review onto every PR
# that merged carrying `cr-out-of-band`.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   `cr-out-of-band` downgrades the CodeRabbit merge-gate block to WARN
#   (docs/agent-rules/merge-gates.md § Per-PR overrides). It waives the GATE,
#   never the REVIEW: 90 PRs merged under it, each leaving a diff on develop
#   that CR either never looked at or looked at and had findings on. This drains
#   that debt.
#
#   Measurements on #1977 (2026-08-16 and 08-18):
#     1. CR ACKNOWLEDGES a review request on a MERGED PR — it answers `Full
#        retroactive review requested for #N`. Whether it then DELIVERS is
#        unconfirmed: no review has ever appeared on #1977, 39h after the first
#        request and 75min after a retry. Do not read the acknowledgement as
#        proof the debt is collectable this way.
#     2. The plan carries ONE included review at a time on a rolling window. A
#        request inside the window answers `Review rate limited … next included
#        review will be available in N minutes` and is DROPPED, not queued. A
#        bounced request must be retried, never assumed pending.
#     3. The silence is NOT specific to merged PRs. On 08-18 CR was equally
#        silent on OPEN PRs — the repo gate's own `@coderabbitai review` nudges
#        on #2119, #2087 and #2084 drew no reply and no review (the last two for
#        ~40h). So the drip is blocked by CR-side capacity, not by the merged-PR
#        route, and it will resume on its own when CR does.
#
#   So a bulk sweep buys one review and 89 rate-limit replies. This fires at
#   most ONE request per invocation and holds when the window is closed.
#
# STATELESS BY DESIGN
#   The first cut of this backfill ran as a session-scoped 15-minute cron that
#   updated a status column in a committed ledger. The session was reclaimed and
#   the drip made ZERO progress in 39 hours — the same class
#   unwatched-pr-nudge.sh was written for (a check-in that was supposed to post
#   a review trigger once CR's quota reopened, and never did). A ledger written
#   by the process that dies cannot report that the process died.
#
#   So no mutable state is kept here. Every question is asked of GitHub:
#     - "has PR N been requested?"  -> N carries a `cr-oob-backfill:` marker
#     - "did the request land?"     -> CR's reply under that marker
#     - "does N still owe a review?"-> N's merged head carries no CR review
#   A run therefore recomputes from scratch and is safe to interrupt, re-run,
#   or run concurrently with itself. It also needs no repo write access —
#   `pull-requests: write` to comment is the whole permission surface.
#
# MODES
#   --poll (default)  One tick: fire a single review request iff the quota
#                     window is open and something is owed. Silent on a hold.
#   --list            Queue status: requested / owed / skipped counts.
#   --selftest        Fixture-driven test of the pure decision core; exit 0/1.
#
# KNOBS
#   SMATCHET_CR_BACKFILL_WINDOW_SECONDS  quota window (default 2700 = 45min).
#   SMATCHET_CR_BACKFILL_QUEUE           queue file (default the repo ledger).
#   SMATCHET_CR_BACKFILL_FIXTURE         decision-input file — the injectable
#                                        data layer used by --selftest + bats.
#   SMATCHET_CR_BACKFILL_NOW             epoch-seconds override for "now".
#   SMATCHET_CR_BACKFILL_CONFIRM_GRACE_SECONDS
#                                        how long an unanswered request may sit
#                                        before the drip halts (default 1800).
#   SMATCHET_CR_BACKFILL_DRY_RUN         1 = print the request, never post it.
#
# gh / network / auth absent -> SILENT exit 0. This is a drip, not a gate; it
# must never wedge a caller that cannot reach GitHub.

#   queue     <pr>                 a PR owed a review, newest merge first

#   confirmed <pr>                 a request CR visibly answered (reply or review)

# The verdict is a pure function of that input — no clock, no network. Keeping
