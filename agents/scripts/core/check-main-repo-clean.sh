# check-main-repo-clean.sh — surface wrong-worktree-path edits at session end.
#
# Problem (process.md 2026-05-19 orchestrator P2 — second documented hit):
# orchestrator running inside a `.claude/worktrees/<id>/` worktree sometimes
# writes Edit/Write absolute paths against the main repo (`C:\Dev\Smatchet\...`)
# instead of the worktree-rooted path. Edits land on whatever branch the main
# repo is currently checked out on (often a parallel agent's branch); the
# orchestrator's actual worktree gets none of the work. Documentation alone
# hasn't prevented recurrence.
#
# This script runs on Stop hook (per .claude/settings.json) and:
#   1. Resolves the main repo via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`.
#   2. Runs `git -C <main> status --short`.
#   3. If non-empty, prints a loud STDERR warning naming each modified file
#      so the orchestrator (or the user reading the transcript) sees the
#      stale state before the session ends.
#   4. Returns 0 always — never blocks the Stop event. Best-effort signal.
#
# Manual invocation (anytime, not just on Stop):
#   bash agents/scripts/core/check-main-repo-clean.sh
#
# Authoritative spec: docs/self-improvement/categories/process.md
# (2026-05-19 orchestrator P2 — option b).
