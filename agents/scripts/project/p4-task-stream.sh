# p4-task-stream.sh — allocate a per-agent Perforce task stream + workspace.
#
# Creates `//smatchet/task-<agent-id>` as a task stream parented to
# `//smatchet/main`, plus a client `task_<agent-id>` rooted at
# `<repo>/.claude/streams/<agent-id>/`, then syncs the workspace to HEAD.
# (Single-segment depot name because `//smatchet` has `StreamDepth: //smatchet/1`;
# override via `P4_TASK_PREFIX` if you rebuild the depot deeper.)
# Idempotent — if stream + client already exist, only the sync runs.
# Idempotent re-populate — if the task stream exists but holds zero revs
# (e.g. a prior populate aborted mid-flight), re-running populates it.
#
# This is the Perforce sibling of `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<id>`
# used by git-only sessions. Triggered by orchestrators that opt into the
# dual-VCS layer with `SMATCHET_AGENT_VCS=p4`.
#
# Phase 2 Step 2 of `docs/plans/shipped/git-to-perforce-migration.md`.
#
# Usage:
#   bash agents/scripts/project/p4-task-stream.sh <agent-id>
#
# Arguments:
#   agent-id — kebab-case identifier, [a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,63}
#
# Required environment (from `bash scripts/dev/setup-p4-env.sh` or persisted
# user-scope env vars — see docs/perforce/SETUP.md § 1):
#   P4PORT   — server addr (e.g. localhost:1666)
#   P4USER   — Perforce user name
#
# Optional environment:
#   P4_STREAM_PARENT  — parent stream (default: //smatchet/main)
#   P4_TASK_PREFIX    — task-stream path prefix INCLUDING trailing separator
#                       (default: //smatchet/task-). Names are single-segment
#                       because depot //smatchet has StreamDepth: //smatchet/1
#                       — a `/` separator would make 2 segments and fail.
#   P4_CLIENT_PREFIX  — client name prefix (default: task)
#   P4_BIN            — p4 executable (default: `p4` from PATH)
#
# Output:
#   stdout — absolute path to the workspace root (caller `cd`s into it)
#   stderr — progress lines
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — workspace ready; path printed to stdout
#   1 — p4 server unreachable / spec submission failed
#   2 — argument / environment error
