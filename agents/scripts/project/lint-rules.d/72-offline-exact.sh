# 72-offline-exact.sh — Quality Pillar 6 (offline-first) EXACT rules (sourced by test-lint-rules.sh, not
# run directly). BLOCKING, delta-gated per changed file: a file fails only when it has MORE hits of a
# rule than its merge-base copy, so existing hits are grandfathered. ADR-0026.
#
# offline-write-bypasses-queue — a tracker write (comment, worklog, watcher, field update, create,
# attach, sprint) called straight on the backend outside the queue seam. Offline, that write is lost;
# route it through the offline queue so it replays on reconnect. Exempt: Source/Core/src/Tracker/ (the
# clients), Source/Core/src/Sync/ (queue + replay), FieldEditPipelineService.cpp (commit-or-queue seam).
#
# tracker-error-kind-collapsed — TrackerErrorUnknown(<one variable>) in tracker code. It throws away the
# Transport kind, so an offline failure reads as permanent and callers wipe cached data (the #21b
# collapse behind the PR #2234 postmortem). Classify where the response is in hand. The
# `classified.IsOk() ? TrackerErrorUnknown(x) : classified` fallback is allowed: each collapse on the hit
# line must itself be the true branch of a ternary whose WHOLE condition is one unnegated `<recv>.IsOk()`
# (the ternary may wrap across the two code lines above). A negated or compound condition (`!c.IsOk()`,
# `a.IsOk() || c.IsOk()`), an unrelated IsOk() check or ternary, comment text, or a valid fallback on a
# previous line never exempts it.
#
# Both rules read only CODE: comments and literal contents are stripped first (offline_code_lines), so a
# comment or string never fires and code before or after a comment on the same line is still scanned.
#
# Escape: a comment-only line // SMATCHET_DEVIATION(rule=<id>; reason=...; owner=...; revisit=...) on the
# nearest non-blank line above the hit. A marker on a line that also holds code never hides that code.
