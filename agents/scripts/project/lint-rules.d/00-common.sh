# True if $1 is a CALENDAR ATTEMPT that revisit_overdue cannot compare. Every such value used to
# fall through to the slug branch and silently become a PERMANENT exemption — the fail-open
# direction, and invisible because the marker still suppresses. Three shapes reached that branch:
#   2026-19-30  month 19 passes the [0-1][0-9] glob and string-sorts after today -> never overdue
#   2020-1-1    not zero-padded, misses the glob entirely -> read as a slug -> never overdue
#   2026-02-30  a day that does not exist in that month; the comparison is lexicographic, not a
#               date parse, so nothing ever rejects it
#
# What counts as an attempt: YYYY- followed by a DIGIT, YYYY-Q…, or 8 bare digits. What does NOT: a
# digit-leading SLUG (2026-roadmap, 2026-H2, 2026-or-later), which docs/agent-rules/cpp-rules.md
# permits and states does not expire. Treating any `YYYY-*` as an attempt — an earlier draft of this
# function — turned every such slug into an unsuppressable hard FAIL, because deviation-overdue is
# absolute and cannot itself be deviated (a rule=deviation-overdue marker is discarded by the DEV_RE
# branch in scan_file_rules), so one digit-leading slug anywhere would block every merge in the repo
# with no escape hatch.
#
# One shape STRICTER than the reference CALENDARISH_RE in test-plan-claim-anchors.sh, which requires
# a full \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} prefix and so reads the unpadded, genuinely-PAST `2020-1-1` as a
# never-expiring slug. That regex was widened to match this, keeping the two enforcers of one
# grammar in agreement; both carry a selftest for the case.
#
# Pure bash (no `date -d`) so the git-bash toolchain behaves the same as the ubuntu runner.
