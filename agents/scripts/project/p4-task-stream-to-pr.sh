# p4-task-stream-to-pr.sh — integrate a Perforce task stream back to main
# and ship the resulting changes as a GitHub PR.
#
# The piece that closes the loop. A subagent finishes work in its task
# stream (allocated by `bash agents/scripts/project/p4-task-stream.sh`); this script
# walks that work back to `//smatchet/main`, then into the canonical git
# working tree (rooted at the same workspace via `smatchet_main_*`), then
# onto a new git branch + push + GitHub PR.
#
# Phase 3 of `docs/plans/shipped/git-to-perforce-migration.md`.
#
# Modes:
#   default (one-shot) — integrate → submit → git push → gh pr create in
#                        one run. Preserves the original Phase-3 behaviour
#                        for callers that don't need a human review gate.
#   --prepare-review-cl — integrate → create a NAMED pending CL on
#                        //smatchet/main (NOT submitted) → shelve. Prints
#                        the CL number on stdout. Used by the p4-gated
#                        ship-loop (docs/plans/shipped/p4-gated-ship-loop.md) so a
#                        human can review the change in P4V before submit.
#   --promote-reviewed-cl <CL> — resume from a CL prepared above. Validates
#                        the CL (exists, pending, current client, matching
#                        `task-stream-id: <agent-id>` tag), submits it,
#                        then runs the git checkout + commit + push + PR.
#                        Refuses on mismatch — prints cleanup commands.
#
# Usage:
#   bash agents/scripts/project/p4-task-stream-to-pr.sh <agent-id> <pr-title> [--dry-run]
#   bash agents/scripts/project/p4-task-stream-to-pr.sh <agent-id> <pr-title> --prepare-review-cl
#   bash agents/scripts/project/p4-task-stream-to-pr.sh <agent-id> <pr-title> --promote-reviewed-cl <CL> [--dry-run]
#
# Arguments:
#   agent-id  — the task stream's agent id (the one used at allocate time)
#   pr-title  — quoted PR title; the script derives a kebab-case branch
#               slug from it (`agent/<agent-id>/<slug>`)
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run — do every step EXCEPT remote actions (`git push` AND
#               `gh pr create`). Useful for integration testing so the
#               PR list doesn't get polluted with test PRs and no stray
#               branch lands on origin. The p4 integrate + submit ARE
#               still real (p4 has no native dry-run for submit).
#               Applies to one-shot AND --promote-reviewed-cl modes.
#               Prints what the git-push + gh invocations would have been.
#   --prepare-review-cl
#               Integrate + shelve only; no submit, no git, no PR.
#   --promote-reviewed-cl <CL>
#               Submit the named pending CL + run the git/PR phase.
#
# Required environment (see docs/perforce/SETUP.md § 1):
#   P4PORT, P4USER
#
# Optional environment:
#   P4_STREAM_PARENT  — integrate target (default: //smatchet/main)
#   P4_TASK_PREFIX    — task-stream path prefix (default: //smatchet/task-)
#   P4_MAIN_CLIENT    — client bound to the integrate target (default:
#                       smatchet_main_${P4USER})
#   P4_BIN            — p4 executable (default: `p4`)
#   GH_BIN            — gh executable (default: `gh`)
#   GIT_BASE_BRANCH   — base branch for the PR (default: develop)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — PR opened (or --dry-run plan printed); URL on stdout. In prepare
#       mode, the pending CL number is printed on stdout.
#   1 — p4 integrate/resolve/submit failed (conflicts or server error)
#   2 — argument / environment error
#   3 — git state precondition failed (dirty tree, wrong branch, missing remote)
#   4 — gh pr create failed (or auth missing)
#   5 — promote-mode CL validation failed (stranded / mismatched / submitted)
#
# Hard rules:
#   - Refuses to run with a dirty git working tree (would conflate p4 imports
#     with unrelated user changes) — except in prepare mode, where the git
#     tree is not touched (preconditions skip the git-clean check).
#   - Refuses to run if `p4 resolve -as` leaves unresolved files (manual
#     resolution required; the orchestrator can re-invoke after fixup).
#   - On `gh pr create` failure, leaves the git branch pushed so the user
#     can open the PR manually via the printed URL.
#   - Promote mode never auto-cleans a stranded CL — prints the manual
#     `p4 shelve -d -c <CL> && p4 change -d <CL>` recipe and refuses.
