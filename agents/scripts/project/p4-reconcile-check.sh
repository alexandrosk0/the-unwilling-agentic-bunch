# p4-reconcile-check.sh — pre-push helper for the dual-VCS contract.
#
# Plan: docs/plans/shipped/git-to-perforce-migration.md § Files to modify §
#       scripts/git-hooks/pre-push:1 — "extend with `p4 reconcile -n` check
#       when client is configured."
#
# Contract: at the canonical tree, `git status --porcelain` and
# `p4 reconcile -n //smatchet/main/...` must agree about which files are
# modified. Drift (a file p4 sees as changed that doesn't appear in git's
# working-tree status) means the p4 side has uncommitted edits that the
# git push is about to leave stranded.
#
# This script:
#   1. Skips silently when SMATCHET_AGENT_VCS != p4 (default git users
#      pay zero cost).
#   2. Skips silently when P4PORT is unset or `p4` is not on PATH.
#   3. Skips silently when `p4 info` is unreachable (server down).
#   4. Otherwise: diffs `p4 reconcile -n` against `git status --porcelain`
#      and warns about any path p4 sees that git doesn't.
#
# Default behaviour: warn (stderr), exit 0.
# Override: SMATCHET_P4_PRE_PUSH_BLOCK=1 → block (exit 2) on drift.
# Override: SMATCHET_AGENT_VCS=p4 + drift detected → block by default.
#
# Mirror of the warn/block pattern in
# docs/harness/claude-code/hooks/pretool-edit-p4-lock-check.sh.

p4-reconcile-check: DRIFT detected.

The following files are open / modified on the p4 side (via
\`p4 reconcile -n\`) but NOT reflected in git's working-tree status:

EOF
# Intentional word-splitting: $drift is a newline-separated list, each entry
# becomes one printf arg → one '  <path>\n' line.
# shellcheck disable=SC2086
printf '  %s\n' $drift >&2
cat >&2 <<EOF

Pushing now would land a git-side state that ignores those p4 edits.
Either:
  (a) submit them via p4 — \`p4 reconcile && p4 submit\` — and re-push, OR
  (b) revert the p4-side opens — \`p4 revert -a\` — if they were noise.

Override (rare, usually wrong): SMATCHET_P4_PRE_PUSH_BLOCK=0 to warn-only.

# Block mode: opt-in via env; defaults on under SMATCHET_AGENT_VCS=p4.
