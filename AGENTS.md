# Smatchet — agent + project rules

This is the canonical entry-point doc for any agentic harness (Claude Code, Codex / OpenAI Agents, Cursor, Aider, generic). Everything an agent needs lives in this repo — no external dependencies on user-global or parent-dir config.

## UX Pillars

Four north-star quality invariants. Pillars 1-3 are **enforceable** (auto-fail PRs that violate them); Pillar 4 is **aspirational** today (backlogged until automated checks land).

| # | Pillar | Hard invariant | Primary owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Performance | Steady-state UI work ≤ **6.94 ms** (144 Hz); p99 ≤ 16.67 ms (60 Hz floor) | `perf-detective` (sustained), `spike-hunter` (p99) |
| 2 | UI never freezes | No UI-thread block > 100 ms without visible cue; sync I/O on UI thread = code-review CRITICAL | `code-review`, `spike-hunter` |
| 3 | Never crash | Sanitizer build clean; RAII + bounds-checked + no silent UB; graceful degradation in ship builds | `debug-detective`, `code-review`, `build-doctor` |
| 4 | Accessibility | Keyboard nav, font scaling, WCAG AA contrast — flagged in backlog (no auto-fail yet) | none today (backlogged) |

Visual-validation exception (Pillar 4 § Visual-validation acceptance): when no bucket-C/E coverage exists for a visual change, the orchestrator pauses the ship-loop and treats the user as the verifier — see [`docs/agent-rules/ship-loops.md`](docs/agent-rules/ship-loops.md) § Visual-validation exception.

Full enforceable-invariant text + visual-cue contract + per-pillar tooling + agent-ownership detail: [`docs/agent-rules/ux-pillars.md`](docs/agent-rules/ux-pillars.md).

## Autonomous ship-loop default

Orchestrator runs each user task end-to-end in **one turn** without pausing per stage. Default sequence:

```
diagnose → fix → build → commit → push → open PR → [gate-check] → squash-merge → git-janitor cleanup → backlog entry
```

Clarifications batched **once at start** via `AskUserQuestion`. After the user answers, the orchestrator **MUST NOT** use `AskUserQuestion` or pause for confirmation until either a defined exception fires or the post-ship 4-option menu. Each stage proceeds to the next automatically. CodeRabbit actionable findings are triaged and fixed autonomously; merge-gate polling starts immediately after PR creation; squash-merge fires immediately on `GATES_PASSED`. Loop pauses ONLY for: (1) debug-detective triggers — the pause-loop **overrides** the ship-loop (see [`docs/agent-rules/delegation.md`](docs/agent-rules/delegation.md) § Debug-mode pause-loop), (2) destructive ops outside scope, (3) cross-repo / external-service mutations, (4) anything not durably authorised, (5) **visual-validation exception** (touches `SmatchetTheme.cpp` / `Smatchet*Ui*.cpp` / `Locales/*.json` / `ImVec4` constants AND no bucket-C/E coverage — pause after build with launched exe, await user verdict).

`SMATCHET_AGENT_VCS=p4` flips the loop to the **P4-gated** variant: smoke build → shelve → user review in P4V → full tests → submit → git branch + push + PR. Git is touched **once**, at the end, after shelf approval AND test-pass. Sub-variants chosen via `AskUserQuestion`: small-change loop (single slice, `//smatchet/main`) or task-stream loop (multi-slice, `scripts/dev/p4-task-stream.sh`).

**Session-start self-check (mandatory, regardless of user-prompt flavour)**. The SessionStart hook (`scripts/clear-session-context.sh`) emits a `## === p4-mode ACTIVE ===` banner into `.session-context.md` when `$SMATCHET_AGENT_VCS=p4` AND `p4 info` succeeds. When the orchestrator sees that banner, it MUST follow the P4-gated ship-loop for ALL subsequent task-loops in this session — even when the user's prompt is git-flavoured (PR numbers, gh URLs, etc.). The env-var opt-in overrides prompt-driven mode inference. On `p4 info` failure the banner reads `## === p4-mode REQUESTED but UNREACHABLE ===` and the orchestrator routes through `AskUserQuestion` per `docs/agent-rules/ship-loops.md` § P4-gated ship-loop (never silently downgrade). `scripts/dev/p4-git-sync-check.sh` checks git-pending vs `p4 opened` alignment and is part of the P4-mode pre-ship verification.

After the loop completes, the orchestrator emits the **post-ship 4-option `AskUserQuestion`**: Manual verify / Review PR / Register with watcher (auto-merges when gates pass) / Done. Skip-condition: if the user already said "merge when green", enter option 3 directly.

Full sequence + per-exception detail + P4-gated phases + post-ship protocol: [`docs/agent-rules/ship-loops.md`](docs/agent-rules/ship-loops.md).

## Merge gates

Before any squash-merge by the orchestrator, `git-janitor`, or `smatchet-merge-watcher`, the gate-poller (`scripts/dev/merge-gates.sh` + `scripts/dev/merge-gates.graphql`) checks three conditions via one `gh api graphql` call:

1. **CI** — every required check on the head commit reaches a passing terminal state (CheckRun: `conclusion ∈ {SUCCESS, NEUTRAL, SKIPPED, STALE}`; StatusContext: `state == SUCCESS`).
2. **CodeRabbit** — `APPROVED` or `COMMENTED + Actionable comments posted: 0` passes; `COMMENTED + N > 0`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `DISMISSED`, `STALE_WITH_FINDINGS`, `STALE_UNKNOWN` block. `NONE` falls through after `MERGE_GATES_CR_GRACE_POLLS` (default 10) expires when CR is installed — but the poller now also auto-posts `@coderabbitai review` once per HEAD on the first blocking `NONE` poll (early-nudge, gated by `MERGE_GATES_STALE_REREVIEW_POLLS`; 0 disables), so CR usually resolves before the grace backstop. **Review-skipped (too many files)** — when CR posts a PR conversation comment saying it skipped review because the PR exceeds its file limit (marker `skip review by coderabbit.ai`; `reviewDecision` stays `NONE`), the gate **blocks** (overriding the NONE grace fall-through, which would otherwise merge a huge unreviewed PR) and suppresses the futile auto-nudge; remediation is to split the PR or apply `cr-out-of-band`. A genuine on-head review always wins over a stale skip comment. The `cr-out-of-band` PR label downgrades any CR block (state verdict, unresolved CR-authored threads, **or** a review-skipped comment) to WARN — CR gate only; CI + user-comment gates still bind.
3. **User comments** — zero unresolved non-outdated review threads from non-bot non-self authors; zero conversation-tab comments from same.

Plus: PR is OPEN, `reviewDecision ∈ {APPROVED, null}`, no GraphQL `hasNextPage` overflow. **Auto-merge applies only when explicitly authorised** (post-ship "Register with watcher" or in-session "merge when green"). When authorised, the caller sets `MERGE_GATES_FLIP_READY=true` so the poller flips draft→ready at start, letting CodeRabbit's `auto_review.drafts:false` config not bypass review on draft PRs (closes the C4 draft-PR bypass per ADR 0006 amendment). Manual CR re-review trigger: `gh pr comment <pr> --body "@coderabbitai review"`. `SKIP_MERGE_GATES=true` at session init bypasses globally; per-PR label overrides (`tests-out-of-band`, `perf-out-of-band`) downgrade specific failing CI checks to WARN, and `cr-out-of-band` downgrades a CodeRabbit block to WARN.

Halt prompts on block / timeout / API-error / closed-externally / pagination overflow route through `AskUserQuestion` with explicit return-code-keyed options. The REST squash-merge contract (`gh api -X PUT repos/.../pulls/N/merge -f merge_method=squash`) is the merge mechanism; conflicts + branch-protection are enforced by GitHub, not duplicated locally.

Full per-outcome semantics + halt-prompt return-code table + env-knob list + REST contract: [`docs/agent-rules/merge-gates.md`](docs/agent-rules/merge-gates.md). Tests: `tests/bats/merge_gates.bats`.

## Project rules

**Doc & agentic structure**: the normative taxonomy + the portable/project boundary live in [`docs/STRUCTURE.md`](docs/STRUCTURE.md); project-specific values (build presets, perf budgets, lint zones, env-prefix, …) live in [`project.config.json`](project.config.json). Portable dirs (`agents/core/`, `agents/_shared/`, `docs/agent-rules/`, `docs/harness/`) read values from the config — don't hardcode (guard: `test-portable-purity`).

**Build**: `cmake --build --preset ninja-iter-msvc` (iter), `ninja-debug-msvc` (debug), `ninja-publish-msvc` (publish). Clang equivalents: `ninja-iter-clang`, `ninja-debug-clang`. Exe at `build/<preset>/Smatchet.exe` (the CMake target is `SmatchetStandalone` but `OUTPUT_NAME` ships as `Smatchet`).

**Language**: C++14 hard (Unreal compat). Banned: `string_view`, `optional`, `variant`, structured bindings, `if constexpr`. Must compile on MSVC + Clang.

**Layout**: `Source/Core/{src,include}` is the shared core — used by both standalone and Unreal. `Source/Standalone/` builds the OpenGL exe. `Source/Plugins/{Mcp,LuaConsole}` are static plugins. `*_DX12` targets are `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` (Unreal only) — don't touch unless asked.

**Available libs** (FetchContent, linked): nlohmann/json, cpr, SQLiteCpp, cpp-httplib, md4c, ImGui (docking), GLFW, Lua + sol2, ghc::filesystem.

**Logging**: `LOG_{DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR,TRACE}` from `Logger.h` — never `printf` / `std::cerr`. Named exceptions (must have matching inline comment): `Source/Standalone/` pre-logger-init fatal paths (`// pre-logger-init — LOG_* unavailable`) and CLI stdout product output (`// CLI stdout — product output, not logging`).

**Exceptions**: catch-all policy in [`docs/agent-rules/exception-handling-policy.md`](docs/agent-rules/exception-handling-policy.md). Empty `catch (...) {}` blocks = review CRITICAL.

**nlohmann json**: `obj["k"] = v`, not `obj = {...}` (reassignment with brace-list won't compile).

**Optional plugins**: gate with `#if SMATCHET_WITH_LUA_AUTOMATION` / `#if SMATCHET_WITH_MCP`. Lua bindings split: `AppController_LuaBindings.cpp` (on) ↔ `AppController_LuaStubs.cpp` (off) — keep in sync.

**Don't**: add GLFW/OpenGL includes to `Source/Core/` headers (DX12 compiles them too); redefine `IMGUI_USE_WCHAR32` (PUBLIC on `ImGuiLib`).

**Dual-target**: `Source/Core/` compiles into both `SmatchetStandalone` (OpenGL+GLFW) and `SmatchetCore_DX12` (Unreal). Diverging macros: `SMATCHET_EMBEDDED_IN_UNREAL=1` (DX12 only); `SMATCHET_WITH_MCP=1` (Standalone only — `SMATCHET_WITH_MCP_UNREAL` is OFF). Full verify: `cmake --build --preset ninja-iter-msvc --target SmatchetStandalone SmatchetCore_DX12`.

**Quality**: RAII (no raw `new`/`delete` — use `std::unique_ptr` + `make_unique`; named exceptions must have inline comment: C ABI ownership boundaries `// C-ABI handle`, custom-deleter wraps `// custom-deleter — make_unique inapplicable`, third-party adapter seams); `const&` for non-trivial params; `std::move` on last use; small focused functions; `LOG_TRACE`/`LOG_DEBUG` in non-trivial branches.

**Lint**: your harness may run an automatic lint pass after C++ edits. Claude Code does so via a `PostToolUse` hook wired by `bash scripts/setup-harness.sh claude-code` — `clang-format -i` applies in place; `cppcheck` + `clang-tidy` report to stderr. If your harness lacks hook automation, run those three tools manually on every edited `.cpp` / `.h` in `Source/Core` / `Plugins` / `Source/Standalone` and fix all reported issues before responding.

**Shell lint**: shell scripts under `scripts/dev/` go through `scripts/dev/test-shell-lint.sh` (5 rules; checklist at [`docs/agent-rules/shell-script-self-review.md`](docs/agent-rules/shell-script-self-review.md)). Auto-runs via `scripts/dev/test-all.sh` at the pre-push gate. Bypass: `SMATCHET_SKIP_SHELL_LINT=1` (logged; emergency-only).

**Tiered enforcement** (high-integrity C++; plan [`docs/plans/active/high-integrity-cpp-enforcement.md`](docs/plans/active/high-integrity-cpp-enforcement.md)): `scripts/dev/test-lint-rules.sh` gates the **strict zone** on a delta basis — every NEW `(rule, file, snippet)` vs `origin/develop` fails CI; existing violators are grandfathered (snapshot: [`docs/high-integrity/baseline.md`](docs/high-integrity/baseline.md)). Delta-gated rules: `no-printf-stderr`, `no-raw-new`, `define-imgui`, `deviation-overdue`. `narrowing-conversions` (clang-tidy) is **opt-in / catalogue-only** — excluded from `--diff` (clang-tidy can't parse the MSVC compile-DB); run it with `SMATCHET_LINT_NARROWING=1` + a clang DB. Zones (the scanner asserts this list matches its own copy via `--selftest`):

- **strict** (any violation fails): `Source/Core/src/Tracker/`, `Source/Core/src/Sync/`, `Source/Core/src/Persistence/`, `Source/Core/src/Config/`, `Source/Core/src/Commands/`, `Source/Plugins/Mcp/` (+ matching `Source/Core/include/` subdirs).
- **light** (not gated; existing inline exemptions apply): `Source/Core/src/Ui/`, `Source/Standalone/`.
- **exempt** (not scanned): `ThirdParty/`, `build/`, non-C++ trees.

**`SMATCHET_DEVIATION` comment** — forward-only superset of the inline exemption markers, for new strict-zone deviations. Grammar (pure comment; zero compile cost; the next non-blank line is the target):

```cpp
// SMATCHET_DEVIATION(rule=<rule-id>; reason=<short>; owner=<handle-or-unowned>; revisit=<YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-Qn | slug | never>)
int w = obj["w"].get<int64_t>();  // suppresses `narrowing-conversions` on this line
```

`rule` = scanner rule-id (suppresses that rule on the next line). `revisit` calendar markers that have passed emit `deviation-overdue` (a strict rule), forcing the audit loop; slug / `never` don't expire. Legacy markers (`// CLI stdout`, `// pre-logger-init`, `// C-ABI handle`, `// custom-deleter`) stay valid in perpetuity.

**Perf workflow**: when the user asks to optimize / profile / fix FPS / lag / hitch / "slow" / spike, read [`docs/guides/perf-workflow.md`](docs/guides/perf-workflow.md) and follow it. Don't load it for unrelated tasks.

**Golden-image approval contract**: any agent that writes or regenerates a checked-in reference artefact a regression gate diffs against (`tests/golden/*.png`, JSON snapshots, deterministic byte streams) MUST hand the file + launched-app handle to the user and wait for explicit approve-golden verdict before `git add`. Iterate the underlying fix on rejection; never amend the golden to match a buggy state. Full recipe + motivating incident + dual-capture-no-golden preference in [`docs/agent-rules/golden-image-approval.md`](docs/agent-rules/golden-image-approval.md).

## Process rules

Rules for **how agents move work through the pipeline** — plan-doc lifecycle, destructive-VCS-op discipline, cadence + verification, and the meta-rule for where future rules land. Companion files: [`docs/agent-rules/merge-gates.md`](docs/agent-rules/merge-gates.md), [`docs/agent-rules/ship-loops.md`](docs/agent-rules/ship-loops.md), [`docs/agent-rules/delegation.md`](docs/agent-rules/delegation.md).

- **Plan-doc family** — every plan lives at `docs/plans/active/<slug>.md`, committed immediately with `wip(plan): <slug>` (working-tree-only files are silently lost on checkout). Post-ship § Implementation log + § Deviations + § Verification update. Stress-test via `grill-with-docs` skill before finalising. Start from `docs/plans/active/_plan-template.md`. **Perf-gate section mandatory** when diff touches `Source/Core/`. **Scope-reduction edits + final-check grep**: when a plan is slimmed by deferring a feature, grep `**/CONTEXT*.md` (covers `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, per-context `src/<ctx>/CONTEXT.md`), `docs/adr/`, `agents/*.md`, and `docs/self-improvement/categories/` for **every symbol named in the now-deferred work** and revise or delete hits that describe deferred-as-current truth. Same grep after any substrate/shape/contract rewrite — hit the keyword family of the changed concept and clear every stray reference. **Plan-revision direct-pushes are PR-only**: revisions to `docs/plans/active/<slug>.md` § Implementation log / § Deviations / § Verification (actual) ship via a follow-up PR (same PR if still open, follow-up PR if already merged) — never direct-push to develop, even for one-line edits. Eliminates classifier-vs-rule drift.
- **Git/p4 discipline** — 5-step pre-flight before any destructive git op (`reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `branch -D`) against a worktree this session didn't personally check out: branch-show, status-short, stash modified, op, decide-stash-fate. Same defensive principle for destructive p4 verbs in p4-mode. Force-push banned globally except a narrow `--force-with-lease` carve-out on `claude/<id>/*` and `agent/<task-stream-id>/*` branches during API-500 recovery (ahead-range zero non-self commits; never bare `--force`). **Worktree-absolute path discipline**: when the session's working directory is under `.claude/worktrees/<id>/`, all `Edit` / `Write` absolute paths MUST use the worktree prefix — not the main-repo prefix. Main-repo-prefixed paths land changes on whatever branch main currently has checked out (often a sibling agent's branch), causing cross-branch contamination. Verify via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` if uncertain.
- **Cadence + verification** — `cmake --build` and `scripts/dev/test-all.sh` run **at most once per slice**, after implementation is complete. Pure-docs slices skip both (`scripts/dev/is-pure-docs-diff.sh`). Trivial-visual envelope skips bucket-E + isolated worktree. Perf scenario auto-runs at slice boundary when the diff hits the curated map. **Stale-read recovery on `Edit`** = Re-Read → diff intended change → Re-Edit (never `replace_all` as force-write). Deferred lint drains once at end-of-turn; `clang-format -i` still runs inline.
- **Deferred plan-file rows** — optional/skipped § Files to modify rows require same-turn `## Deviations from plan` + backlog entry when follow-up work remains (`docs/agent-rules/process-rules.md`).
- **Memory drain** — the harness auto-memory inbox (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`) is transient, not durable. A `SessionStart` nudge (`scripts/dev/memory-drain-nudge.sh`) fires when it holds ≥ 5 items or any item is > 7 days old; act via the `/drain-memory` skill (or "drain memory"). Triage every item: **implement** (→ `AGENTS.md` / `docs/agent-rules/*`), **backlog** (→ `docs/self-improvement/categories/*`), or **toss** — verifying each claim against the current tree first, then clearing drained rows. A cloud routine can't drain it (dir is machine-local). Spec: [`docs/agent-rules/memory-drain.md`](docs/agent-rules/memory-drain.md).
- **Where new rules go** — 1-liners stay in § Project rules above; rules that fit an extracted topic land in that file; > 30-line new topics get their own `docs/agent-rules/<topic>.md` + stub here; ≤ 30-line orphans go in `process-rules.md` (the catch-all) rather than fragmenting.

Full sub-rule text + canonical recipes + carve-out exclusion list + hot-files list + the deferred-lint pipeline: [`docs/agent-rules/process-rules.md`](docs/agent-rules/process-rules.md).

## Debug techniques

**Pink-clear UI gap detection**: for "is the background ever visible behind panels?" / "are dock gaps still leaking?" questions, set the clear color to magenta (`glClearColor(1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)` on Standalone, equivalent `ClearRenderTargetView` color on DX12). Any visible pink is a guaranteed dock gap or transparent region. Pair with a screenshot + per-pixel pink scan for objective regression tests.

**Exe staleness check**: after every rebuild, `ls -la` both the patched output and the most-likely-stale exe paths side-by-side, compare mtimes, and name the **exact** path the user should run. Multiple build outputs (`build/ninja-iter-msvc/`, `build/ninja-debug-msvc/`, `build/ninja-publish-msvc/`, worktree builds) make wrong-exe testing a common time-sink — orchestrator + perf / build agents all enforce this.

## Semantic codebase search — use it first

Every agent in this repo expects the orchestrator (or the agent itself) to use **semantic codebase search** before falling back to text-search. In practice that means:

- **Always** call the harness's indexed codebase search first for any "where is X" / "what calls Y" / "what does this touch" question. This is faster, cheaper, and more accurate than raw `grep` over a multi-MLOC codebase.
- Prefer **compact file-skeleton views** (signatures + classes only) for files you're inspecting but not editing — typically 70–90% token savings vs full reads.
- Fall back to text-search + full reads only when no semantic search is available or its index is degraded.

Under Claude Code this maps to `mcp__vexp__run_pipeline` (semantic search) and `mcp__vexp__get_skeleton` (skeleton). Other harnesses substitute their equivalents (see the Harness adapter table below). Agents whose prose mentions vexp do so as a concrete example — the capability is what matters.

## Agent file locations

Canonical, single source of truth: `agents/<name>.md` at the repo root (per the [agents.md spec](https://agents.md/)). Shared scripts + skills live at `agents/_shared/`.

Per-harness adapter directories (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`) are **gitignored** — they're regenerated locally from the canonical tree by `bash scripts/setup-harness.sh <name>`. Adapters use directory junctions / symlinks where possible so edits to `agents/*.md` are picked up by the harness immediately, no sync step.

First-time setup or fresh clone? See [`docs/harness/SETUP.md`](docs/harness/SETUP.md).

## Delegation

**Moved to** [`docs/agent-rules/delegation.md`](docs/agent-rules/delegation.md) (~230 lines lifted out for navigability — AGENTS.md is now ~320 lines instead of 549).

Default: stay in the orchestrator's primary model for routine work. Delegate to an agent in `agents/` when the task matches.

Quick index of moved subsections — full content in `docs/agent-rules/delegation.md`:

- **Orchestrator delegation packet** — plan-lock pre-flight, shared inventory, invariant decisions, output budget, plan revision contract, subagent progress markers reminder, pure-helper TU-split recipe.
- **Parallel dispatch** — when to run multiple subagents in one tool-use block.
- **Session scratchpad protocol** — `.session-context.md` lifecycle + `## Session context append` shape.
- **Subagent progress markers** — `.progress.log` via `bash scripts/dev/agent-progress.sh`.
- **Tool-trace contract** — hook-derived; agents don't track manually.
- **Agent output contract** — 5-class table (Investigator / Diagnostic read-edit / Implementer / Helper / Maintenance) + `## Outcome:` mandate.
- **Trigger auto-activation** — keyword → agent routing table.
- **Debug-mode pause-loop (overrides ship-loop)** — for `debug-detective` triggers.
- **API-500 mid-run recovery** — 5-step recovery for delegated agents that error API-500 after shipping file edits; `git add -A` gotcha; force-push carve-out for spawned-agent branches.
- **Skeleton-first** — `get_skeleton` for inspection, `Read` for editing.
- **Agent versioning** — when to bump `version: <N>`.
- **Cross-cutting** + **Subsystem specialists** — delegation tables.
- **Stay in the orchestrator for** — routine work list.
- **Heuristic** — when to delegate vs handle directly.
- **`delegates-to:` frontmatter** — direct call vs orchestrator-routed.
- **Why split** + **Complexity rationale** — design intent.

External references to `AGENTS.md § <subsection>` continue to resolve via this index — agents who read AGENTS.md land here, see the cross-link, and follow it to the canonical text. Don't maintain parallel copies; edit the canonical at `docs/agent-rules/delegation.md`.

## Self-improvement loop

Every delegated agent ends its report with a `## Self-improvement` section. **Empty is the common case and explicitly fine** — agents only flag real friction, never make up suggestions.

Operational rules — format, categories (`bug` / `process` / `tooling` / `infra` / `test` / `security`), priority enum (P0–P3), workflow steps, apply threshold, triage cadence — live alongside the index at [`docs/self-improvement/AGENT_SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`](docs/self-improvement/AGENT_SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md). Live entries split per category under [`docs/self-improvement/categories/`](docs/self-improvement/categories/). Applied entries archive immediately to `self-improvement/categories/applied.md`. The goal is a self-tightening loop — agents notice friction, the orchestrator accumulates evidence, prompts get patched, friction drops.

## Dual-VCS topology (Perforce as opt-in local layer)

Smatchet runs git/GitHub as the **ship-line** (PR review, CI, `smatchet-merge-watcher`) and Perforce as an **opt-in local layer** (`SMATCHET_AGENT_VCS=p4`; default `git`) for agentic-WIP primitives — named server-side shelves, atomic counters as plan-locks, exclusive `+l` file locks, task streams as parallel-isolation primitives. The Perforce layer is purely additive: never required, never authoritative, never on the ship-line.

Concern-by-concern git ↔ p4 mapping + verb-level TL;DR + lock discipline + shelf-vs-stash + destructive-p4-op pre-flight: [`docs/perforce/AGENT_FLOWS.md`](docs/perforce/AGENT_FLOWS.md). Bring-up: [`docs/perforce/SETUP.md`](docs/perforce/SETUP.md). Janitor: [`agents/core/p4-janitor.md`](agents/core/p4-janitor.md). Plan: [`docs/plans/shipped/git-to-perforce-migration.md`](docs/plans/shipped/git-to-perforce-migration.md).

## Harness adapter

Each agent declares a closed set of **capability tags**. The orchestrator (and the harness) maps tags to concrete tools. Currently known mappings:

| Capability tag | Claude Code | Codex / OpenAI Agents | Cursor | Aider | Generic CLI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `semantic-code-search` | `mcp__vexp__run_pipeline` | vexp.run_pipeline (MCP) | (built-in search panel) | (not built-in — fall back to text-search) | `rg` over symbol set |
| `file-skeleton` | `mcp__vexp__get_skeleton` | vexp.get_skeleton (MCP) | — | — | `ctags -x <file>` |
| `file-read` | `Read` | `read_file` | (built-in) | (built-in) | `cat` |
| `file-edit` | `Edit` | `apply_patch` | (built-in) | (built-in) | `sed` / patch |
| `text-search` | `Grep` | `rg` (shell) | (built-in) | (built-in) | `grep` / `rg` |
| `file-glob` | `Glob` | shell `find` | — | — | `find` |
| `shell` | `Bash` | `shell` | terminal | shell | sh |
| `web-fetch` | `WebFetch` | `web.fetch` | — | — | `curl` |
| `git-history` | `Bash(git log)` | `shell(git log)` | (built-in) | (built-in) | `git log` |

**Harness notes:**

- **Claude Code** discovers agents at `.claude/agents/` — a junction into the canonical `agents/` tree created by `bash scripts/setup-harness.sh claude-code`. Edits to `agents/*.md` are visible immediately; no sync step.
- **Codex / OpenAI Agents** reads `AGENTS.md` per the [agents.md spec](https://agents.md/). Discover individual agents at `agents/*.md`.
- **Cursor / Aider / generic** — human-driven. Agent files at `agents/` are reference docs the user pastes or invokes manually.
- Harnesses without `semantic-code-search` should fall back to text-search with the symbol set named in each agent's prose. Output is degraded but workable — expect more round-trips and larger context per query.

**Per-agent harness hints**: each agent's YAML frontmatter may carry a `harness-hints.<harness>:` block with harness-specific routing details (e.g. Anthropic model selection, MCP tool list). Harnesses ignore unknown blocks.

## Recommended companion — caveman

Output-token compressor (~75% cut, technical content preserved byte-for-byte). Install + use instructions: [`docs/guides/caveman.md`](docs/guides/caveman.md). Default: `/caveman full` at session start.

## Semantic-search exceptions

- **Exhaustive literal / symbol inventories**: use text-search (`rg` / harness equivalent), not semantic search. Graph-ranked results are not exhaustive. Run the search once in the orchestrator and pass `<file>:<line>:<role>` matches inline to delegated agents.
- **Mechanical renames and cleanup checks**: same — every occurrence must be found. `mechanic` and `perf-instrument` already use text-search per their prompts.
- **Understanding impact / ownership / surrounding logic**: semantic search stays primary. This is the default path.

## vexp — Claude-Code-only

The vexp MCP-tool guidance block (`run_pipeline`, `get_skeleton`, etc.) is Claude-Code-specific and lives in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (regenerated by the vexp tool; sourced from `docs/harness/claude-code/CLAUDE.md.tmpl`). It is deliberately **not** mirrored here so Codex / Cursor / Aider — which read `AGENTS.md` per the [agents.md spec](https://agents.md/) — don't carry Claude-Code-only MCP guidance they cannot use. Those harnesses fall back to text-search per § Harness adapter.

The vexp tool currently auto-regenerates its block into `AGENTS.md` on every install / update, which is wrong per the above rationale. `scripts/dev/vexp-strip-agents-md.sh` (wired as a SessionStart hook in `.claude/settings.json`) idempotently strips the block on every Claude Code session start until the upstream tool is patched to target `.claude/CLAUDE.md` only. Tracked: `docs/plans/active/unblock-external-blockers-2-3-4.md` § Slice 2.
