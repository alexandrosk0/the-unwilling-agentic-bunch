# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# core.hooksPath repair in agents/scripts/core/setup-harness.sh (install_git_hooks,
# reached through the `git-hooks` subcommand) and the matching doctor.sh WARN
# (tooling 2026-08-19, absolute core.hooksPath serves a stale hook to worktrees).
# doctor.sh is the host's (scripts/dev/doctor.sh): its two cases skip in a
# standalone layer checkout.
#
# git runs a hook from the worktree root, so the relative `scripts/git-hooks`
# resolves inside each worktree, while an absolute path into the main checkout
# makes every worktree run main's revision of the hooks. The fixture is a temp
# repo whose main checkout and linked worktree carry DIFFERENT pre-commit hooks
# that each write their own name to a marker, so "which hook ran" is observable.
# Both scripts are committed into the fixture and run from it, so they resolve
# their roots there and never touch the real repo's config.
#
# Requires: bash, git (>= 2.20 for extensions.worktreeConfig), bats.
