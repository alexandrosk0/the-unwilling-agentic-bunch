# ── Gate-logic staleness wiring (script-freshness-remaining-callers, P3) ──────
# These assert the CALL, not the library — script_freshness.bats already covers
# fresh/stale/unverifiable classification and the print policy. What is untested
# elsewhere, and what actually regressed on the other callers, is the wiring:
# whether the script locates the lib RELATIVE TO ITSELF and passes its real
# declared set. A hook that is present but never reached is the same invisible
# no-op this whole line of work exists to close, so it gets a live assertion
# rather than a grep over the source.
#
# Method: run a COPY of the script beside a stub lib. ISSUE_SWEEP_DIR is derived
# from BASH_SOURCE, so the copy sources the stub instead of the real library,
# and the stub records exactly what it was called with.
