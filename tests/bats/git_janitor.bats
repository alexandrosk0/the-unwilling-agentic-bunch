# git_janitor.bats — regression suite for agents/scripts/core/git-janitor.sh
# (the post-merge cleanup wrapper).
#
# Scope: the argument-validation + refusal guards that gate the destructive
# Steps 4-6 (checkout develop / ff-merge / branch -D / dual-target build). The
# happy path needs a real MERGED PR + cmake, so it is out of scope here; every
# guard that STOPS the script before it mutates anything is covered:
#   - usage errors (missing --post-merge, missing/non-numeric pr-number) -> 2
#   - uncommitted user work in the tree -> 1 (REFUSE)
#   - PR not MERGED on GitHub -> 1 (REFUSE)
#   - a live sibling session + default DEFER -> 0 (skip HEAD-mutating cleanup)
#
# gh + cmake + git are stubbed on PATH so no network / build / HEAD move occurs.
# The stubs are deliberately minimal — each test sets only what its guard reads.
