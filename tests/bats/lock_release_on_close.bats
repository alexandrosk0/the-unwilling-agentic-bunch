# tests/bats/lock_release_on_close.bats
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Regression suite for agents/scripts/core/lock-release-on-close.sh — the
# branch-keyed plan-lock release lock-cleanup.yml runs on every PR close, and
# the --slug release lock-release-dispatch.yml runs on demand.
#
# Runs the REAL script against a sandbox bare remote whose locks are claimed
# with the REAL lock-claim.sh (so the claim.json `.branch` field is exactly
# what production writes). Two feature locks (feat/x, feat/y) per test:
#   - a close of feat/x with no lock-slug line releases ONLY x's lock;
#   - a bare `holds-lock:` line in the body releases neither;
#   - develop/main and project.config.json vcs.protected_branches are never
#     released by branch match;
#   - a fork head (HEAD_REPO != BASE_REPO) releases nothing;
#   - --slug releases one named lock whatever branch claimed it.
# Also pins the host's lock-release-dispatch.yml wiring (input via env, --slug
# mode); those cases read the host file and skip in a standalone layer checkout.
#
# Requires: bash, git, python(3), bats.
