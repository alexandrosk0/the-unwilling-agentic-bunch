# tests/bats/script_freshness.bats
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bats tests for agents/scripts/core/lib/script-freshness.sh — the shared
# gate-logic staleness detector (gate-tooling-run-from-stale-session-branch,
# process P1). Extracted from merge-gates.sh so pre-ship.sh and the other core
# gates inherit it; staleness in pre-ship fails in the WORSE direction (false
# GREENS — it passes a diff current develop would reject).
#
# Two layers are covered:
#   1. script_freshness_verdict — the fresh/stale/unverifiable classification,
#      driven through the positional blob-injection seam so no git/network is
#      needed, plus real-git cases in a throwaway repo.
#   2. warn_if_script_stale — the advisory wrapper's print/silence policy, and
#      its `set -e` safety (see below).
#
# THE `set -e` CASES ARE THE POINT, not padding. This helper is SOURCED into
# scripts that own their own shell options, several of which run `set -euo
# pipefail`. A bare `var="$(cmd)"` assignment propagates cmd's status, so a
# missing file would kill the calling gate outright. merge-gates.sh's inline
# original was accidentally immune (it used `local var="$(cmd)"`, and `local`'s
# own success masks the failure) — a mask the extraction loses. That regression
# was real: it took down pre-ship.sh's --selftest on first wiring. These tests
# pin the fix.
#
# Requires: bash, git, bats.
